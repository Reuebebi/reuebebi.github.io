                    This comprehensive lesson will guide you through the powerful methodologies essential for mastering <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">DC circuits analysis</span>. We will begin with the cornerstone principles known as <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">Kirchhoff's Laws</span>, which are fundamental to all circuit analysis.

                    Formulated by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1845, <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">Kirchhoff's Laws</span> are two fundamental principles that govern the behavior of current and voltage in electrical circuits. They are direct consequences of the conservation of charge and the conservation of energy, respectively. These laws are universally applicable to any electrical circuit, regardless of its complexity.

This law is a direct manifestation of the <span class="font-medium text-white">conservation of charge</span>, meaning that charge cannot accumulate at a junction.

                    The <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">Superposition Theorem</span> is a powerful linear circuit analysis technique that simplifies the process of finding the current or voltage in a circuit with multiple independent sources (voltage sources and current sources). It states that in any linear circuit containing multiple independent sources, the current through or voltage across any element is the algebraic sum of the currents or voltages produced by each independent source acting alone.

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">

It cannot be used for circuits with non-linear components (like diodes or transistors) or for calculating power, as power is a non-linear function ($P = I^2R$ or $P = V^2/R$).
