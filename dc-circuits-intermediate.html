            <!-- Section 1: Kirchhoff's Laws - The Foundation -->
            <section class="bg-gray-800 bg-opacity-70 rounded-2xl p-10 shadow-xl border border-gray-700 transition duration-300 ease-in-out hover:shadow-2xl">
                <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-6 border-b-2 border-blue-500 pb-3">Kirchhoff's Laws: The Foundation of Circuit Analysis</h2>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Gustav Kirchhoff's circuit laws are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of current and voltage in electrical circuits. They are derived from the conservation of charge and energy.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">1. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) / Junction Rule</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)</span>, also known as the Junction Rule, is based on the principle of <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">conservation of electric charge</span>. It states that the algebraic sum of currents entering a junction (or node) in a circuit is equal to the algebraic sum of currents leaving that junction.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-center text-xl font-bold text-blue-400">
                    Mathematically:
                    $$ \sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out} $$
                    Or equivalently:
                    $$ \sum I = 0 \quad \text{(at any node)} $$
                    Where currents entering the node are typically considered positive and currents leaving are negative (or vice versa, as long as consistent).
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Explanation:</span> Electric charge cannot accumulate at a junction; whatever charge flows in must flow out. There are no "storage" points for charge in an instantaneous sense at a junction.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Application:</span> KCL is used to write equations relating the currents at each junction in a circuit. For a circuit with $N$ nodes, you can write $N-1$ independent KCL equations.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">2. Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) / Loop Rule</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)</span>, also known as the Loop Rule, is based on the principle of <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">conservation of energy</span>. It states that the algebraic sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop in a circuit must be zero.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-center text-xl font-bold text-blue-400">
                    Mathematically:
                    $$ \sum \Delta V = 0 \quad \text{(around any closed loop)} $$
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Explanation:</span> As you trace a path around a closed loop, starting and ending at the same point, the total energy gained or lost by a hypothetical unit charge must be zero. Any potential rises (e.g., across a battery) must be balanced by potential drops (e.g., across resistors).
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Application:</span> KVL is used to write equations relating the voltage drops and rises around each closed loop (mesh) in a circuit. Each independent loop yields one KVL equation.

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Sign Convention for KVL</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">

Assume currents leaving the node are positive (or entering are positive, just be consistent). The current flowing through a resistor between two nodes ($V_A$ and $V_B$) is given by Ohm's Law: $I = (V_A - V_B)/R$.

                                Where $V_y$ is the voltage of an adjacent node, and $R_{xy}$ is the resistance between $V_x$ and $V_y$.</li>
                            <li>Current sources connected to the node are included directly in the KCL equation.</li>
                            <li>If a voltage source is directly connected between a non-reference node and the reference node, that node's voltage is known.</li>
                            <li>If a voltage source is between two unknown nodes (a "supernode" scenario), a modified approach is needed: treat the two nodes and the voltage source as a single "supernode" and apply KCL to the boundary of this supernode, then write an additional equation relating the two node voltages based on the voltage source.</li>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Our journey through <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">DC Circuits Analysis</span> on <span class="font-semibold text-white">Whizmath</span> has equipped you with a formidable set of tools for dissecting and understanding complex electrical networks. We began with the foundational <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">Kirchhoff's Laws</span>, recognizing the <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Junction Rule ($\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$)</span> as a statement of charge conservation and the <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Loop Rule ($\sum \Delta V = 0$)</span> as a manifestation of energy conservation.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Building upon these principles, we explored two powerful systematic methods:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        <li>The <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">Node Voltage Method</span>, which simplifies analysis by solving for potentials at independent nodes using KCL.</li>
                        <li>The <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">Mesh Current Method</span>, which simplifies analysis by solving for fictitious circulating currents in closed loops using KVL.</li>
                    </ul>
                    These methods transform complex circuit problems into solvable systems of linear algebraic equations.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Furthermore, we introduced the <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Superposition Theorem</span>, an elegant technique that allows us to analyze circuits with multiple independent sources by considering the effect of each source individually and then summing the results. This provides a powerful way to break down seemingly intractable problems into manageable parts.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Mastering these techniques—Kirchhoff's Laws, Node Voltage, Mesh Current, and Superposition—is essential for anyone delving into electrical engineering, electronics design, or advanced physics. They provide the analytical framework to accurately predict current flow, voltage distribution, and power dissipation in virtually any linear DC circuit.
