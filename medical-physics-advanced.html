                <h2 class="text-4xl">2. Physics of the Human Body: A Biomechanical & Physiological Perspective</h2>
                <p>
                    Before delving into the medical applications of physics, it's crucial to understand that the human body itself is a marvel of physical systems, governed by mechanical, fluid, electrical, and thermodynamic principles. <strong>Medical Physics</strong> begins with this foundational understanding.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">2.1. Biomechanics: The Mechanics of Living Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Biomechanics</strong> applies principles of mechanics (forces, motion, stress, strain) to biological systems. It studies how forces interact with living structures, how the body moves, and how it withstands loads.
                </p>
                <h4>2.1.1. Skeletal System & Levers</h4>
                <p>
                    The human skeleton acts as a system of levers, enabling movement through the action of muscles. Bones provide support and act as rigid levers, while joints serve as fulcrums. Muscles provide the effort force. Understanding leverage in the body is critical for analyzing movement, posture, and the forces experienced by joints during daily activities or exercise.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First-Class Lever:</strong> Fulcrum is between effort and load (e.g., neck muscles extending the head).</li>
                    <li><strong>Second-Class Lever:</strong> Load is between fulcrum and effort (e.g., standing on tiptoes).</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Class Lever:</strong> Effort is between fulcrum and load (e.g., bicep curl; most common in the body).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2.1.2. Stress, Strain, and Material Properties of Tissues</h4>
                <p>
                    Tissues in the body (bone, cartilage, tendon, muscle) have distinct mechanical properties.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stress ($\sigma$):</strong> Force per unit area exerted on a material ($ \sigma = F/A $).</li>
                    <li><strong>Strain ($\epsilon$):</strong> The fractional deformation of a material in response to stress ($ \epsilon = \Delta L/L_0 $).</li>
                    <li><strong>Elasticity:</strong> The ability of a tissue to deform under stress and return to its original shape (e.g., tendons, ligaments).</li>
                    <li><strong>Viscoelasticity:</strong> Many biological tissues exhibit time-dependent deformation and recovery, showing properties of both viscous fluids and elastic solids (e.g., cartilage).</li>
                    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> The maximum stress a tissue can withstand before breaking (e.g., tensile strength, compressive strength).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Understanding these properties is crucial in orthopedics, sports medicine, and designing prosthetics.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">2.2. Fluid Dynamics in the Circulatory and Respiratory Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    The flow of blood and air within the body is governed by principles of fluid mechanics.
                </p>
                <h4>2.2.1. Blood Flow (Circulatory System)</h4>
                <p>
                    Blood circulation is a complex fluid dynamic system.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Poiseuille's Law:</strong> Describes laminar flow in a cylindrical tube, showing that flow rate is highly dependent on the radius of the vessel ($Q \propto r^4$). This explains why small changes in vessel diameter (e.g., due to plaque buildup) have a dramatic effect on blood flow and resistance.
                        <div class="equation">
                            $Q = \frac{\pi r^4 \Delta P}{8 \eta L}$
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            where $Q$ is flow rate, $r$ is vessel radius, $\Delta P$ is pressure drop, $\eta$ is blood viscosity, and $L$ is vessel length.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Blood Pressure:</strong> The force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. It is a key indicator of cardiovascular health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turbulence:</strong> While blood flow is largely laminar in large vessels, turbulence can occur in narrowed or diseased arteries, contributing to murmurs and energy loss.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2.2.2. Airflow (Respiratory System)</h4>
                <p>
                    Breathing involves the movement of air in and out of the lungs, driven by pressure gradients created by muscle contraction. Airflow resistance is affected by airway diameter and lung elasticity.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">2.3. Heat Transfer and Thermoregulation</h3>
                <p>
                    The human body maintains a remarkably constant core temperature through intricate mechanisms of heat production and heat loss.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Metabolic Heat Production:</strong> Cellular metabolism constantly generates heat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heat Transfer Mechanisms:</strong> The body exchanges heat with the environment via:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Conduction:</strong> Transfer through direct contact.</li>
                            <li><strong>Convection:</strong> Transfer through fluid movement (e.g., blood flow to skin, air currents).</li>
                            <li><strong>Radiation:</strong> Emission or absorption of electromagnetic waves (e.g., infrared).</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> Heat loss through the vaporization of sweat.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Understanding thermoregulation is vital for preventing hypothermia/hyperthermia, designing medical garments, and optimizing surgical environments.

            <section id="diagnostic-imaging-xray" class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-4xl">3. Diagnostic Imaging: X-rays & Radiography</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>X-rays</strong> are a form of electromagnetic radiation with short wavelengths and high energy, capable of penetrating matter. Their discovery by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895 revolutionized medicine, providing the first non-invasive way to visualize internal body structures.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">3.1. Principles of X-ray Production</h3>
                <p>
                    X-rays are produced when high-speed electrons are rapidly decelerated or interact with target atoms in an X-ray tube.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X-ray Tube:</strong> Consists of an evacuated glass envelope with a cathode (filament) and an anode (target).
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cathode:</strong> Heated filament emits electrons (thermionic emission).</li>
                            <li><strong>Anode:</strong> A rotating tungsten target, positively charged to accelerate electrons towards it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Electron Acceleration:</strong> A high voltage (typically 20-150 kV) is applied between the cathode and anode, accelerating electrons to high kinetic energies.</li>
                    <li><strong>X-ray Generation:</strong> When these high-energy electrons strike the anode, two types of X-rays are produced:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bremsstrahlung (Braking Radiation):</strong> Electrons are decelerated by the electric field of atomic nuclei, emitting a continuous spectrum of X-ray energies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Characteristic X-rays:</strong> High-energy electrons eject inner-shell electrons from target atoms. When outer-shell electrons fill these vacancies, they emit X-rays with discrete energies characteristic of the target material (e.g., K-alpha, K-beta lines).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Only about 1% of the electron energy is converted to X-rays; the rest is dissipated as heat, requiring anode rotation and cooling.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">3.2. Interaction of X-rays with Matter</h3>
                <p>
                    The formation of an X-ray image relies on how X-rays are attenuated (absorbed or scattered) as they pass through different tissues. Attenuation depends on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Atomic Number ($Z$):</strong> Higher atomic number materials absorb more X-rays (e.g., bone, with higher calcium content, appears white).</li>
                    <li><strong>Density ($\rho$):</strong> Denser materials absorb more X-rays.</li>
                    <li><strong>X-ray Energy:</strong> Lower energy X-rays are absorbed more readily.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Primary interaction mechanisms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Photoelectric Effect:</strong> X-ray photon transfers all its energy to an inner-shell electron, ejecting it. This is the dominant absorption mechanism and contributes most to image contrast. The probability of this effect is proportional to $Z^3/E^3$.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compton Scattering:</strong> X-ray photon scatters off an outer-shell electron, losing some energy and changing direction. This contributes to image fog (noise) but is less dependent on $Z$.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pair Production:</strong> At very high energies ($>1.022$ MeV), a photon converts into an electron-positron pair near a nucleus. Primarily relevant in radiation therapy, not diagnostic imaging.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">3.3. Radiography (Plain X-ray)</h3>
                <p>
                    In conventional radiography, X-rays pass through the patient onto a detector (film or digital panel). Areas that absorb more X-rays (like bones) appear white on the image (radiopaque), while areas that absorb less (like soft tissues, air) appear darker (radiolucent).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Image Quality Factors:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The difference in brightness between adjacent areas (influenced by kVp, tissue type).</li>
                    <li><strong>Density (Brightness):</strong> Overall blackness/whiteness of the image (influenced by mAs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The ability to distinguish small details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distortion:</strong> Misrepresentation of object size or shape.</li>
                    <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Random fluctuations in image signal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">3.4. Computed Tomography (CT Scan)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Computed Tomography (CT)</strong> uses multiple X-ray projections taken from different angles around the patient to create cross-sectional (tomographic) images of the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Principle:</strong> An X-ray tube rotates around the patient, emitting a fan-shaped or cone-shaped beam. Detectors on the opposite side measure the transmitted X-rays. A computer then uses complex algorithms (e.g., filtered back-projection, iterative reconstruction) to reconstruct detailed 3D images of internal structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CT images are displayed in Hounsfield Units (HU), a quantitative scale of radiodensity (e.g., air = -1000 HU, water = 0 HU, bone = +1000 HU). CT provides excellent spatial resolution and differentiates tissues better than plain X-rays, making it invaluable for diagnosing conditions in the brain, chest, abdomen, and bones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Contrast Agents:</strong> Iodine-based (for blood vessels) or barium-based (for GI tract) contrast agents are often used to enhance visibility of specific structures.

                <h2 class="text-4xl">4. Diagnostic Imaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</strong> is a powerful diagnostic technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed images of organs and soft tissues. Unlike X-rays or CT, MRI does not use ionizing radiation, making it safer for repeated scans. It primarily images the distribution and properties of water protons in the body.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">4.1. Basic Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)</h3>
                <p>
                    MRI is based on the phenomenon of <strong>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)</strong>.
                </p>
                <h4>4.1.1. Proton Spin and Magnetic Moment</h4>
                <p>
                    The human body is mostly water, and water molecules contain hydrogen atoms. The nucleus of a hydrogen atom is a single proton, which has an intrinsic property called <strong>spin</strong>. This spin makes the proton behave like a tiny magnet (a magnetic dipole moment).
                </p>
                <h4>4.1.2. Alignment in a Strong Magnetic Field ($B_0$)</h4>
                <p>
                    When a patient is placed in a strong external magnetic field ($B_0$) of an MRI scanner, these randomly oriented protons align themselves either parallel or anti-parallel to the main magnetic field. A slight majority align parallel (lower energy state). These aligned protons precess (wobble) around the direction of $B_0$ at a specific frequency called the <strong>Larmor frequency ($\omega_0$)</strong>:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $\omega_0 = \gamma B_0$
                </div>
                <p>
                    where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio (a constant for a given nucleus, specific for protons). This frequency is in the radiofrequency (RF) range.
                </p>
                <h4>4.1.3. RF Pulse and Resonance</h4>
                <p>
                    A short, powerful pulse of radio waves (RF pulse) is then applied at the exact Larmor frequency. This RF pulse "flips" some of the aligned protons into the higher energy, anti-parallel state and causes them to precess in phase (coherently).
                </p>
                <h4>4.1.4. Signal Detection and Relaxation</h4>
                <p>
                    When the RF pulse is turned off, the excited protons return to their original lower energy state, losing their coherence and re-aligning with the $B_0$ field. As they "relax," they emit RF signals (electromagnetic waves) at the Larmor frequency. These signals are detected by receiver coils in the MRI scanner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relaxation process occurs via two independent mechanisms, characterized by time constants:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>T1 Relaxation (Longitudinal Relaxation):</strong> The time it takes for the longitudinal magnetization (alignment with $B_0$) to recover to 63% of its original value. This involves energy exchange with the surrounding lattice (spin-lattice relaxation). T1 is typically shorter in fatty tissues and longer in water-rich tissues.</li>
                    <li><strong>T2 Relaxation (Transverse Relaxation):</strong> The time it takes for the transverse magnetization (coherence of precessing spins) to decay to 37% of its initial value. This is due to spin-spin interactions and local magnetic field inhomogeneities. T2 is typically shorter in tissues with less mobile water (e.g., bone) and longer in free water.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">4.2. Image Formation in MRI</h3>
                <p>
                    To create an image, the emitted RF signals must be localized in space. This is achieved by applying additional, weaker magnetic fields called <strong>gradient coils</strong>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slice Selection Gradient:</strong> Selects a specific slice of the body by making the Larmor frequency vary linearly along one direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phase Encoding Gradient:</strong> Briefly applied to vary the phase of precession linearly across the selected slice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frequency Encoding Gradient:</strong> Applied during signal reception to make the Larmor frequency vary linearly in another direction within the slice.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By manipulating these gradients, the emitted signals can be spatially encoded. A <strong>Fourier Transform</strong> is then used to convert the received complex signal into a spatially resolved image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Different tissue types have different T1 and T2 relaxation times. By varying the timing sequences of the RF pulses and gradient fields (e.g., TR: repetition time, TE: echo time), MRI scanners can create images that are "T1-weighted" (good for anatomy), "T2-weighted" (good for pathology like inflammation), or "proton density-weighted," providing excellent contrast for soft tissues.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">4.3. MRI Hardware: Superconducting Magnets</h3>
                <p>
                    MRI scanners require extremely strong and stable magnetic fields. This is achieved using <strong>superconducting magnets</strong>, typically cooled by liquid helium to cryogenic temperatures ($\approx 4 \text{ K}$). Once charged, these magnets can maintain a persistent current indefinitely, generating a constant magnetic field without external power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The use of superconducting magnets in MRI is a direct application of <strong>Cryogenics & Low Temperature Physics</strong> (as discussed in the relevant lesson), enabling the high field strengths required for detailed imaging.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">4.4. Advantages and Limitations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Excellent soft tissue contrast (brain, spinal cord, muscles, ligaments, tumors), no ionizing radiation, versatility (functional MRI, diffusion MRI).</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Long scan times, high cost, noisy, requires strong magnetic fields (contraindicated for patients with certain metal implants like pacemakers), limited bone imaging (due to low proton density in cortical bone).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-4xl">5. Diagnostic Imaging: Ultrasound Imaging</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ultrasound imaging</strong> (sonography) uses high-frequency sound waves to create real-time images of internal body structures. It is non-invasive, does not use ionizing radiation, and is particularly useful for visualizing soft tissues, fluid-filled structures, and fetal development during pregnancy.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">5.1. Principles of Ultrasound</h3>
                <p>
                    Ultrasound imaging relies on the generation, transmission, and detection of sound waves.
                </p>
                <h4>5.1.1. Sound Waves and Frequencies</h4>
                <p>
                    Ultrasound uses sound waves with frequencies typically ranging from 2 to 18 MHz (megahertz), well above the human hearing range (20 Hz to 20 kHz).
                </p>
                <h4>5.1.2. Piezoelectric Effect and Transducers</h4>
                <p>
                    The heart of an ultrasound system is the <strong>transducer</strong> (probe). This device uses the <strong>piezoelectric effect</strong>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Generating Ultrasound:</strong> When an alternating electric voltage is applied across piezoelectric crystals (e.g., lead zirconate titanate, PZT), they rapidly change shape, producing high-frequency sound waves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Detecting Echoes:</strong> Conversely, when sound waves strike the piezoelectric crystals, they deform, generating an electrical signal that can be detected.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Thus, the same transducer element can act as both a transmitter and a receiver. Transducers are designed to be acoustically matched to the body using a coupling gel, minimizing reflection at the skin surface.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">5.2. Pulse-Echo Principle and Image Formation</h3>
                <p>
                    Ultrasound imaging works on the <strong>pulse-echo principle</strong>, similar to sonar or radar.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The transducer emits a short pulse of ultrasound waves into the body.</li>
                    <li>As the sound waves travel, they encounter interfaces between tissues with different acoustic properties (e.g., muscle/fat, blood/vessel wall).</li>
                    <li>At these interfaces, some of the sound energy is reflected back as an "echo" to the transducer.</li>
                    <li>The transducer listens for these echoes. The time it takes for an echo to return determines the depth of the reflecting structure (speed of sound in tissue is approximately 1540 m/s).
                        <div class="equation">
                            $d = \frac{v \cdot t}{2}$
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            where $d$ is depth, $v$ is speed of sound, and $t$ is time.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The intensity of the echo determines the brightness of the pixel at that depth.</li>
                    <li>By sending out many pulses and receiving echoes as the transducer scans across the body, a real-time 2D image (B-mode image) is built up. Modern systems also create 3D/4D images.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">5.3. Acoustic Properties of Tissues</h3>
                <p>
                    The quality of ultrasound images depends on the acoustic properties of tissues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Acoustic Impedance ($Z_{acoustic}$):</strong> A measure of a material's resistance to the propagation of sound waves. It depends on density ($\rho$) and speed of sound ($v$): $Z_{acoustic} = \rho \cdot v$.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Occurs at interfaces where there is a large difference in acoustic impedance (e.g., soft tissue-bone, soft tissue-air). Strong reflections create bright echoes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> Conversion of sound energy into heat as it propagates through tissue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scattering:</strong> Occurs when sound encounters small, irregular structures (e.g., blood cells).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Bone and air are strong reflectors/attenuators, which is why ultrasound struggles to image structures behind them (e.g., brain through skull, lungs through ribs).
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">5.4. Doppler Ultrasound: Measuring Flow</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Doppler ultrasound</strong> utilizes the <strong>Doppler effect</strong> (change in frequency of a wave due to relative motion between source and receiver) to measure blood flow velocity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When ultrasound waves reflect off moving red blood cells, their frequency changes. This frequency shift (Doppler shift, $\Delta f$) is directly proportional to the velocity of the blood flow.
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $\Delta f = \frac{2 f_0 v \cos\theta}{c}$
                </div>
                <p>
                    where $f_0$ is emitted frequency, $v$ is blood velocity, $\theta$ is angle between ultrasound beam and flow direction, and $c$ is speed of sound in tissue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doppler ultrasound is invaluable for diagnosing vascular diseases (e.g., blockages, narrowed arteries), assessing fetal blood flow, and evaluating cardiac function. Color Doppler displays flow direction and speed as a color overlay on the B-mode image.

                <h2 class="text-4xl">6. Diagnostic Imaging: Nuclear Medicine</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Nuclear Medicine</strong> is a specialized field that uses small amounts of radioactive materials, called <strong>radiopharmaceuticals</strong> or <strong>radiotracers</strong>, to diagnose and treat diseases. Unlike diagnostic X-rays which provide anatomical information, nuclear medicine focuses on functional imaging, showing how organs and tissues are working.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">6.1. Principles of Radioactivity</h3>
                <p>
                    Nuclear medicine relies on the phenomenon of <strong>radioactivity</strong>, where unstable atomic nuclei (radionuclides) spontaneously decay, emitting radiation in the process.
                </p>
                <h4>6.1.1. Radioactive Decay and Half-Life</h4>
                <p>
                    The decay of radioactive isotopes follows exponential decay. The <strong>half-life ($T_{1/2}$)</strong> is the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay. Each radionuclide has a characteristic half-life, ranging from microseconds to billions of years.
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$
                </div>
                <p>
                    where $N(t)$ is number of undecayed nuclei at time $t$, $N_0$ is initial number, and $\lambda$ is decay constant ($\lambda = \ln(2)/T_{1/2}$).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine typically have short half-lives (hours to days) to minimize patient radiation dose while allowing sufficient time for imaging.
                </p>
                <h4>6.1.2. Types of Emissions Relevant to Nuclear Medicine</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gamma ($\gamma$) emission:</strong> High-energy electromagnetic radiation emitted from the nucleus. Gamma rays are detected directly in SPECT and PET. Technetium-99m ($^{99m}\text{Tc}$) is the most common diagnostic gamma emitter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Positron ($\beta^+$) emission:</strong> A positron (antimatter equivalent of an electron) is emitted. The positron travels a short distance, annihilates with an electron, producing two 511 keV gamma rays emitted 180 degrees apart. This is the basis of PET imaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Beta ($\beta^-$) emission:</strong> An electron is emitted from the nucleus. Used in some therapeutic applications (e.g., Iodine-131 for thyroid cancer).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">6.2. Radiopharmaceuticals (Tracers)</h3>
                <p>
                    A <strong>radiopharmaceutical</strong> consists of a radionuclide (the "label") chemically attached to a pharmaceutical molecule (the "carrier"). The carrier molecule is chosen to target a specific organ, tissue, or physiological process in the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once injected, the radiotracer concentrates in the target area, and the emitted radiation is detected externally to create an image reflecting the physiological function or pathology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>$^{99m}\text{Tc}$-MDP for bone scans (detects bone metabolism/growth).</li>
                    <li>$^{18}\text{F}$-FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) for PET scans (detects glucose metabolism, often elevated in cancer).</li>
                    <li>$^{123}\text{I}$ or $^{131}\text{I}$ for thyroid scans (thyroid gland naturally takes up iodine).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">6.3. Gamma Camera and SPECT</h3>
                <p>
                    A <strong>Gamma Camera</strong> (or Anger camera) is used to detect gamma rays emitted from radiotracers within the body.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collimator:</strong> A lead plate with holes that filters out scattered gamma rays, allowing only those traveling parallel to the holes to reach the detector.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scintillation Crystal:</strong> (e.g., NaI(Tl)) absorbs gamma rays and emits light photons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs):</strong> Convert light photons into electrical signals, which are then processed to determine the location and energy of the detected gamma ray.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)</strong> is an extension of gamma camera imaging. Multiple 2D images are acquired as the gamma camera rotates around the patient. Computer algorithms then reconstruct 3D cross-sectional images, similar to CT, providing more precise localization of the radiotracer distribution. SPECT is widely used for heart (perfusion), bone, and brain imaging.

                <h3 class="text-3xl">6.4. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</strong> uses positron-emitting radiotracers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Principle:</strong>
                </p>
                    <li>A positron-emitting radiotracer is injected. The emitted positron travels a few millimeters and then annihilates with an electron in the body.</li>
                    <li>This annihilation produces two 511 keV gamma rays that travel in almost exactly opposite directions (180 degrees apart).</li>
                    <li>The PET scanner detects these coincident (simultaneously arriving) gamma rays using a ring of detectors. The lines connecting the two detected photons define a "line of response" (LOR).</li>
                    <li>By collecting millions of these LORs, a computer can reconstruct a 3D map of the radiotracer concentration within the body.</li>
                <p>
                    PET offers higher sensitivity and resolution than SPECT and is particularly powerful when combined with CT (PET/CT) or MRI (PET/MRI) for fused anatomical and functional information, especially in oncology (cancer detection and staging), neurology, and cardiology.

                <h2 class="text-4xl">7. Radiation Therapy: Targeted Treatment for Cancer</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Radiation Therapy</strong> (or radiotherapy) is a cornerstone of cancer treatment, using high-energy radiation to damage the DNA of cancer cells, leading to their death while minimizing harm to surrounding healthy tissues. Approximately half of all cancer patients receive some form of radiation therapy.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">7.1. Principles of Radiation Biology</h3>
                <p>
                    Radiation therapy works by ionizing atoms within cells, directly or indirectly damaging DNA.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct Action:</strong> Radiation directly breaks chemical bonds in DNA molecules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Indirect Action:</strong> Radiation interacts with water molecules (the most abundant component of cells) to produce highly reactive free radicals (e.g., hydroxyl radicals, $\cdot\text{OH}$). These free radicals then chemically damage DNA. Indirect action is the dominant mechanism for X-rays and gamma rays.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Damaged cancer cells either die immediately or lose their ability to divide and reproduce, eventually leading to tumor shrinkage and eradication. Healthy cells are generally more capable of repairing radiation damage, and treatment plans are designed to exploit this differential sensitivity.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">7.2. Types of Radiation Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Photons (X-rays and Gamma rays):</strong> Most common in external beam radiation therapy. X-rays are produced by linear accelerators, while gamma rays come from radioactive sources like Cobalt-60 (though less common now). Photons deposit energy throughout their path, with a peak dose near the surface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrons:</strong> Used for treating superficial tumors (e.g., skin cancers) because they have a finite range and deliver their dose primarily near the surface, sparing deeper tissues. Produced by linear accelerators.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protons (Particle Therapy):</strong> Heavy charged particles that have a unique dose deposition profile. They deposit most of their energy at a specific, controllable depth (the <strong>Bragg Peak</strong>) and then stop, with very little dose beyond the tumor. This allows for highly conformal treatment, sparing surrounding healthy tissue (e.g., for tumors near sensitive organs like the brain, spinal cord, or in pediatric patients).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">7.3. External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)</h3>
                <p>
                    In EBRT, a machine outside the body directs a beam of radiation to the tumor.
                </p>
                <h4>7.3.1. Linear Accelerators (Linacs)</h4>
                <p>
                    The most common device for EBRT. Linacs accelerate electrons to high energies using microwaves, then either:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct the electron beam at the patient (for electron therapy).</li>
                    <li>Direct the electron beam onto a heavy metal target (e.g., tungsten) to produce high-energy X-rays (photons) via Bremsstrahlung for photon therapy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Linacs can produce a range of photon and electron energies, are very reliable, and can be precisely controlled to shape the radiation beam. Modern linacs are capable of advanced techniques like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT):</strong> Delivers non-uniform radiation beams from multiple angles, allowing the dose to conform precisely to the tumor while minimizing dose to adjacent healthy structures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT):</strong> Uses imaging (X-ray, CT) before or during each treatment session to verify tumor position and adjust beam delivery in real-time, accounting for organ motion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) / Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT):</strong> Delivers very high doses of radiation in a single or a few fractions with extreme precision to small tumors, often using a large number of intersecting beams.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">7.4. Brachytherapy (Internal Radiation Therapy)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Brachytherapy</strong> involves placing radioactive sources directly inside or very close to the tumor. This delivers a high dose of radiation to a small area while rapidly decreasing dose to surrounding healthy tissue.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temporary Brachytherapy:</strong> High-dose-rate (HDR) or low-dose-rate (LDR) radioactive sources are inserted into the body for a specific period and then removed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Permanent Brachytherapy:</strong> Small radioactive "seeds" are permanently implanted into the tumor (e.g., for prostate cancer).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Brachytherapy is used for various cancers, including prostate, breast, cervical, and skin cancers.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">7.5. Radiation Dosimetry and Treatment Planning</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Dosimetry</strong> is the accurate measurement and calculation of the radiation dose delivered to a patient. Medical physicists are crucial for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Calibration:</strong> Ensuring radiation therapy machines deliver the precise dose they are set to.</li>
                    <li><strong>Treatment Planning:</strong> Using patient imaging (CT, MRI) and sophisticated computer software to design a treatment plan that optimizes dose to the tumor while sparing healthy tissues and critical organs. This involves calculating dose distributions in 3D.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality Assurance (QA):</strong> Regularly testing equipment and procedures to ensure accuracy and safety.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The unit of absorbed dose is the Gray (Gy), representing 1 Joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of mass.

                <h2 class="text-4xl">8. Radiation Safety & Protection</h2>
                <p>
                    Given the inherent risks of ionizing radiation, <strong>radiation safety and protection</strong> are paramount in <strong>Medical Physics</strong>. The goal is to minimize radiation exposure to patients, staff, and the public, while maximizing the diagnostic or therapeutic benefit.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">8.1. Biological Effects of Radiation</h3>
                <p>
                    Ionizing radiation can cause biological damage by interacting with DNA and other cellular components.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deterministic Effects:</strong> Occur above a threshold dose and severity increases with dose (e.g., skin burns, radiation sickness). Cell death is the primary mechanism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stochastic Effects:</strong> Occur without a threshold dose, and the probability of occurrence increases with dose, but severity is independent of dose (e.g., cancer induction, genetic mutations). These arise from DNA damage and faulty repair.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The risk of stochastic effects, particularly cancer, is the primary concern for low doses encountered in diagnostic imaging.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">8.2. Principles of Radiation Protection (ALARA)</h3>
                <p>
                    The guiding principle for radiation protection is <strong>ALARA: As Low As Reasonably Achievable</strong>. This means all radiation exposures should be kept as low as is practical, considering economic and social factors, while still achieving the desired medical outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ALARA is implemented through three key strategies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> Minimize the duration of exposure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Maximize the distance from the radiation source (intensity decreases with the inverse square of distance).</li>
                    <li><strong>Shielding:</strong> Use appropriate materials (e.g., lead, concrete) to absorb radiation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">8.3. Radiation Units and Dosimetry</h3>
                <p>
                    Accurate quantification of radiation and its biological effects is essential.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Activity (Bq, Ci):</strong> Measures the rate of radioactive decay (number of disintegrations per second).
                        <ul>
                            <li>Becquerel (Bq): 1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second.</li>
                            <li>Curie (Ci): $1 \text{ Ci} = 3.7 \times 10^{10} \text{ Bq}$.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Absorbed Dose (Gy):</strong> Measures the amount of energy absorbed by a material per unit mass.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gray (Gy): $1 \text{ Gy} = 1 \text{ J/kg}$.</li>
                            <li>Rad (radiation absorbed dose): $1 \text{ rad} = 0.01 \text{ Gy}$.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Equivalent Dose (Sv):</strong> Accounts for the different biological effectiveness of various types of radiation. Equivalent Dose (Sv) = Absorbed Dose (Gy) $\times$ Radiation Weighting Factor ($W_R$). $W_R = 1$ for X-rays, gamma rays, electrons; $W_R \approx 2-20$ for neutrons, protons, alpha particles.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sievert (Sv): Unit of equivalent dose.</li>
                            <li>Rem (roentgen equivalent man): $1 \text{ rem} = 0.01 \text{ Sv}$.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Effective Dose (Sv):</strong> Considers the varying sensitivity of different organs and tissues to radiation. Effective Dose (Sv) = $\sum_T W_T \times H_T$, where $W_T$ is tissue weighting factor and $H_T$ is equivalent dose to tissue T. It provides a measure of the overall risk to the whole body.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Medical physicists perform complex calculations and measurements (dosimetry) to ensure that patients receive the intended therapeutic dose in radiation oncology and that diagnostic exposures are kept ALARA.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">8.4. Quality Assurance (QA) and Regulations</h3>
                <p>
                    Rigorous <strong>Quality Assurance (QA)</strong> programs are implemented in medical imaging and radiation therapy departments. These involve:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular calibration and maintenance of equipment.</li>
                    <li>Daily, weekly, and monthly checks of machine output and safety features.</li>
                    <li>Patient-specific quality checks to verify treatment plan accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Adherence to national and international regulations (e.g., IAEA, NCRP) to ensure patient and staff safety.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    QA is a critical responsibility of medical physicists to ensure that the complex physics technology operates reliably and safely in the clinical environment.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Principle:</strong> A radiopharmaceutical is designed with a diagnostic isotope (e.g., positron emitter for PET) and a therapeutic isotope (e.g., beta emitter for therapy) chemically bound to the same targeting molecule.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The diagnostic isotope is used to image the patient, confirming that the target molecule accumulates in the tumor. This helps select patients who will benefit from the therapy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> If accumulation is confirmed, the therapeutic isotope is administered, delivering a targeted radiation dose directly to the cancer cells with minimal impact on healthy tissue.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Examples include PSMA-targeted theranostics for prostate cancer. This approach represents a paradigm shift towards highly personalized and precise medicine.

                    <li><strong>Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT):</strong> A highly targeted therapy that involves administering a non-radioactive boron compound which preferentially accumulates in tumor cells. The tumor is then irradiated with a low-energy neutron beam. The neutrons are captured by the boron nuclei, producing high-energy alpha particles and lithium nuclei that selectively destroy the tumor cells, with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue.</li>
                    <li><strong>MR-Guided Linacs:</strong> Integrating an MRI scanner directly with a linear accelerator, allowing for real-time visualization of the tumor and surrounding organs during radiation delivery. This enables adaptive planning and precise beam tracking to account for organ motion, significantly improving treatment accuracy.</li>
