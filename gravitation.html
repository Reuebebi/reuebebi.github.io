            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Welcome to the profound and all-encompassing force of <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Gravitation</span>. In <span class="text-blue-400">physics</span>, <span class="text-blue-400">gravitation</span> is the natural phenomenon by which all things with <span class="text-blue-400">mass</span> or <span class="text-blue-400">energy</span>—including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light—are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another. It is the dominant <span class="text-blue-400">force</span> at astronomical distances and the reason why apples fall from trees, why we are held to the Earth, and why planets orbit the Sun.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Prior to the 17th century, the motions of celestial bodies and objects falling on Earth were often considered separate phenomena. It was Sir Isaac Newton who, in his groundbreaking work *Principia Mathematica*, unified these observations under a single, elegant law: the <span class="text-blue-400">Law of Universal Gravitation</span>. This law revolutionized our understanding of the universe, providing a mathematical framework to explain the intricate dances of planets, the formation of stars, and the very structure of galaxies.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
                In this comprehensive lesson, we will meticulously unpack <span class="text-blue-400">Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation</span>, examining its formula and the factors that influence the attractive <span class="text-blue-400">force</span> between <span class="text-blue-400">masses</span>. We will then introduce the concept of a <span class="text-blue-400">gravitational field</span>, an invisible region of influence around any <span class="text-blue-400">mass</span>. Next, we'll clarify the often-confused distinction between <span class="text-blue-400">mass</span> and <span class="text-blue-400">weight</span>. Finally, we will explore the basic principles of <span class="text-blue-400">planetary motion</span>, drawing connections to <span class="text-blue-400">Kepler's Laws</span>, which empirically describe how celestial bodies move. Prepare to be pulled into a deeper understanding of the cosmos with <span class="text-blue-400 font-bold">Whizmath</span>!

                Sir Isaac Newton's stroke of genius was to realize that the <span class="text-blue-400">force</span> that makes an apple fall to Earth is the same <span class="text-blue-400">force</span> that keeps the Moon in orbit around Earth and Earth in orbit around the Sun. This universal attraction between any two objects possessing <span class="text-blue-400">mass</span> is described by his <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Law of Universal Gravitation</span>.

                The <span class="text-blue-400">law</span> states that every particle of <span class="text-blue-400">matter</span> in the universe attracts every other particle with a <span class="text-blue-400">force</span> that is directly proportional to the product of their <span class="text-blue-400">masses</span> and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

                    <li><span class="text-blue-400">Inverse Square Law:</span> The <span class="text-blue-400">gravitational force</span> decreases rapidly as the distance between objects increases.

                    <li><span class="text-blue-400">Proportional to Mass:</span> The <span class="text-blue-400">force</span> is directly proportional to the product of the <span class="text-blue-400">masses</span>.

            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Before Newton, Johannes Kepler formulated three empirical laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun, based on meticulous astronomical observations by Tycho Brahe. Newton later showed that these <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Kepler's Laws</span> were a direct consequence of his own <span class="text-blue-400">Law of Universal Gravitation</span> and <span class="text-blue-400">Laws of Motion</span>, providing a powerful demonstration of the unifying power of his theory.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-blue-300 mb-2">1. Kepler's First Law: The Law of Orbits</h3>

                <li><span class="font-semibold">Elliptical Orbits:</span> This was a radical departure from the long-held belief in perfect circular orbits. An <span class="text-blue-400">ellipse</span> is an elongated circle, with two focal points. The Sun is at one of these focal points, not necessarily at the center.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Perihelion and Aphelion:</span> For a planet orbiting the Sun, the point of closest approach is called <span class="text-blue-400">perihelion</span>, and the point of farthest distance is <span class="text-blue-400">aphelion</span>.</li>

                <li><span class="font-semibold">Conservation of Angular Momentum:</span> Newton later showed that this law is a consequence of the <span class="text-blue-400">conservation of angular momentum</span>, as the gravitational force (which acts along the line joining the planet and the Sun) produces no torque relative to the Sun.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-blue-300 mb-2 mt-8">3. Kepler's Third Law: The Law of Periods</h3>

                Where $T$ is the orbital period (time for one full orbit) and $r$ is the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit (for circular orbits, $r$ is simply the radius). The constant is the same for all planets orbiting the same central body (e.g., all planets orbiting the Sun).
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <span class="font-semibold">Newton's Derivation of Kepler's Third Law:</span>
                Newton combined his <span class="text-blue-400">Law of Universal Gravitation</span> with his <span class="text-blue-400">Second Law of Motion</span> and the formula for centripetal force for a circular orbit to derive Kepler's Third Law.
                For a circular orbit, the <span class="text-blue-400">gravitational force</span> provides the <span class="text-blue-400">centripetal force</span>:
                $$ F_g = F_c $$
                $$ G \frac{M_s m_p}{r^2} = m_p \frac{v^2}{r} $$
                Where $M_s$ is the mass of the Sun, $m_p$ is the mass of the planet, $r$ is the orbital radius, and $v$ is the orbital speed.
                Since $v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$ for a circular orbit, substitute this into the equation:
                $$ G \frac{M_s}{r^2} = \left( \frac{2\pi r}{T} \right)^2 \frac{1}{r} $$
                $$ G \frac{M_s}{r^2} = \frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{T^2 r} = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2} $$
                Rearranging to solve for $T^2$:
                $$ T^2 = \left( \frac{4\pi^2}{G M_s} \right) r^3 $$
                Here, $\frac{4\pi^2}{G M_s}$ is a constant for all objects orbiting the Sun, thus proving Kepler's Third Law from fundamental principles. This was a monumental achievement in <span class="text-blue-400">physics</span>.

                The negative sign indicates that the <span class="text-blue-400">gravitational force</span> is always attractive. The zero reference point for this potential energy is conventionally chosen when the two <span class="text-blue-400">masses</span> are infinitely far apart ($r \rightarrow \infty$), where $U_g = 0$. As <span class="text-blue-400">masses</span> get closer, the potential energy becomes more negative, reflecting the fact that <span class="text-blue-400">work</span> is done *by* the <span class="text-blue-400">gravitational force</span> as they attract, and the system becomes more stable.
