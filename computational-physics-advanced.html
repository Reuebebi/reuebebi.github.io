            <p>
                Many fundamental laws of physics are expressed as differential equations. While some simple cases admit analytical (exact) solutions, the vast majority of real-world physical systems lead to equations that are too complex to solve by hand. <span class="key-concept">Numerical methods</span> provide systematic algorithms to approximate solutions to these equations using arithmetic operations, making them solvable by computers.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-white">2.1. Numerical Integration (Quadrature)</h4>
            <p>
                Numerical integration, also known as quadrature, is the process of approximating the value of a definite integral. This is essential for calculating quantities like potential energy from a force, work done, or probabilities from a distribution.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> The integral is approximated by summing the areas of simple geometric shapes (rectangles, trapezoids) under the function's curve over small intervals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rectangle Rule (Midpoint Rule):</strong> The simplest method. The area under the curve in each interval is approximated by a rectangle whose height is the function's value at the midpoint of the interval.
                    <div class="math-block">
                        $\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f\left(\frac{x_i + x_{i+1}}{2}\right) \Delta x$
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Trapezoidal Rule:</strong> Approximates the area under the curve in each interval as a trapezoid. This is generally more accurate than the rectangle rule for a given number of intervals.
                    <div class="math-block">
                        $\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{\Delta x}{2} [f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \ldots + 2f(x_{N-1}) + f(x_N)]$
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Simpson's Rule:</strong> A higher-order method that approximates the function within each pair of intervals using a parabolic segment. It requires an even number of intervals ($N$).
                    <div class="math-block">
                        $\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{\Delta x}{3} [f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 4f(x_3) + \ldots + 2f(x_{N-2}) + 4f(x_{N-1}) + f(x_N)]$
                    </div>
                    Simpson's rule typically offers a much higher accuracy for the same number of function evaluations compared to the trapezoidal rule, converging faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gaussian Quadrature (Brief Mention):</strong> A more advanced method that chooses optimal sampling points and weights, offering very high accuracy for smooth functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Error Analysis:</strong> The accuracy of numerical integration depends on the method used and the step size ($\Delta x$). Higher-order methods generally have smaller truncation errors.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-white">2.2. Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)</h4>
            <p>
                Many physical systems are described by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), which relate a function to its derivatives with respect to a single independent variable (often time). Examples include Newton's second law for a particle, or the equations governing electrical circuits.

            <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Euler Method:</strong> The simplest (and often least accurate) method for solving first-order ODEs. It uses the derivative at the current point to estimate the value at the next point.

                        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> First-order method; global error is proportional to $\Delta t$.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Can be unstable for large $\Delta t$, especially for "stiff" equations (where solutions change rapidly).</li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Runge-Kutta Methods (RK):</strong> A family of more sophisticated and widely used methods for higher accuracy and stability.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>RK2 (Heun's Method, Midpoint Method):</strong> Second-order accuracy.

                <li>
                    <strong>Adaptive Step-Size Methods:</strong> Many RK implementations (e.g., Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg) use varying step sizes ($\Delta t$) to maintain a desired level of accuracy while minimizing computational cost, especially useful for problems where the solution changes at different rates.

                    Using forward difference for time and central difference for space, we get an explicit finite difference scheme:

                        $\frac{u(x, t+\Delta t) - u(x,t)}{\Delta t} = \alpha \frac{u(x+\Delta x, t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x-\Delta x, t)}{(\Delta x)^2}$

                        $u_{i}^{j+1} = u_{i}^{j} + \frac{\alpha \Delta t}{(\Delta x)^2} (u_{i+1}^{j} - 2u_{i}^{j} + u_{i-1}^{j})$

                    <strong>Stability Criteria:</strong> For explicit methods (where the next time step is calculated directly from current values), there are often stability conditions that relate $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$. For the 1D heat equation, $\frac{\alpha \Delta t}{(\Delta x)^2} \leq \frac{1}{2}$ for stability. Violating this can lead to unphysical, growing oscillations. Implicit methods are generally more stable but computationally more intensive per time step.

            <p>
                <span class="key-concept">Monte Carlo (MC) simulations</span> are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. They are particularly powerful for solving problems that are intractable through deterministic algorithms or for simulating systems with a large number of interacting components or inherent randomness.

            <h4 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-white">3.1. Basic Principle of Monte Carlo</h4>
            <p>
                The core idea is to use random numbers to sample a space or simulate a process, and then infer properties of the system from the statistical behavior of these samples.

            <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Random Number Generators (RNGs):</strong> At the heart of any Monte Carlo simulation is a source of random numbers. Computers typically use <span class="key-concept">pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs)</span>, which generate sequences of numbers that appear random but are actually deterministic (generated from an initial "seed"). Good PRNGs are crucial for reliable simulations.

                <li>
                    <strong>Law of Large Numbers:</strong> The validity of Monte Carlo methods rests on the law of large numbers, which states that as the number of samples increases, the average of the samples will converge to the expected value.

                Monte Carlo methods can be used to estimate definite integrals, especially in high dimensions where traditional quadrature methods become computationally unfeasible.

            <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> To estimate the integral of a function $f(x)$ over a domain, randomly sample points within that domain. The average value of $f(x)$ at these sampled points, multiplied by the volume of the domain, provides an estimate of the integral.
                    <div class="math-block">
                        $\int_D f(x) dx \approx V \langle f \rangle = V \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)$

                <li>
                    <strong>Accuracy:</strong> The error in Monte Carlo integration typically decreases as $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of samples. This convergence rate is independent of the dimensionality of the integral, making it superior for high-dimensional integrals.
