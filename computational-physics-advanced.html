            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Many problems in <span class="text-blue-400">physics</span> are described by differential equations (equations involving derivatives), but finding exact analytical solutions to these equations is often impossible. <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Numerical methods</span> provide a way to approximate these solutions using iterative computational steps.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-blue-300 mb-2">The Finite Difference Method</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Finite Difference Method (FDM)</span> is one of the most widely used numerical techniques for solving differential equations. The core idea is to replace derivatives in a differential equation with <span class="text-blue-400">finite difference approximations</span>, turning a continuous problem into a discrete one that can be solved algebraically using a computer.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-200 leading-relaxed ml-4 mb-4">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Discretization:</span> The continuous domain (e.g., time, space) is divided into a grid of discrete points. The function's value is calculated at these specific points.</li>

                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                        <li>A first derivative $\frac{df}{dx}$ at a point $x_i$ can be approximated by:
                            $$ \frac{df}{dx} \approx \frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)}{\Delta x} \quad \text{(Forward Difference)} $$
                            or
                            $$ \frac{df}{dx} \approx \frac{f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})}{\Delta x} \quad \text{(Backward Difference)} $$
                            or, more accurately:
                            $$ \frac{df}{dx} \approx \frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1})}{2\Delta x} \quad \text{(Central Difference)} $$
                            where $\Delta x$ is the spacing between grid points.
                        </li>
                        <li>Second derivatives (common in many <span class="text-blue-400">physics</span> equations, like the <span class="text-blue-400">wave equation</span> or <span class="text-blue-400">heat equation</span>) can also be approximated.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li><span class="font-semibold">Solving the System:</span> Once derivatives are replaced, the differential equation transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations that can be solved numerically for the unknown values at each grid point.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <span class="font-semibold">Conceptual Example: Falling Object with Air Resistance</span>
                Consider an object falling with both <span class="text-blue-400">gravity</span> and <span class="text-blue-400">air resistance</span>. Newton's Second Law gives us:
                $$ m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - cv^2 $$
                where $m$ is mass, $g$ is acceleration due to <span class="text-blue-400">gravity</span>, and $c$ is a constant related to <span class="text-blue-400">air resistance</span>. This is a non-linear differential equation. Using FDM, we can approximate $\frac{dv}{dt}$ as $\frac{v_{i+1} - v_i}{\Delta t}$. This allows us to calculate the velocity at the next time step ($v_{i+1}$) from the current one ($v_i$):
                $$ v_{i+1} = v_i + \Delta t \left( g - \frac{c}{m} v_i^2 \right) $$
                By iteratively applying this equation, starting from an initial velocity, we can numerically plot the velocity of the falling object over time.

            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Monte Carlo methods</span> are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. They are particularly effective for problems that are too complex to solve analytically, especially those involving many interacting components, high dimensionality, or inherent stochastic (random) processes.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-blue-300 mb-2">The Core Idea: Random Sampling</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The fundamental principle is to use random numbers to sample a large number of configurations or paths of a system. By observing the statistical properties of these random samples, one can deduce the properties of the overall system.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-200 leading-relaxed ml-4 mb-4">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Example: Estimating Pi ($\pi$) using Monte Carlo</span>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4">
                        <li>Draw a square of side length 2, centered at the origin. Its area is $2^2 = 4$.</li>
                        <li>Inscribe a circle of radius 1 within the square. Its area is $\pi (1)^2 = \pi$.</li>
                        <li>Randomly generate a large number of points $(x,y)$ within the square ($-1 \le x \le 1$, $-1 \le y \le 1$).</li>
                        <li>Count how many of these points fall inside the circle (i.e., $x^2 + y^2 \le 1$).</li>
                        <li>The ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points generated will approximate the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area:
                            $$ \frac{\text{Points Inside Circle}}{\text{Total Points}} \approx \frac{\text{Area of Circle}}{\text{Area of Square}} = \frac{\pi}{4} $$
                            Thus, $\pi \approx 4 \times \frac{\text{Points Inside Circle}}{\text{Total Points}}$. The more points generated, the more accurate the estimate.

                <span class="text-blue-400">Monte Carlo methods</span> are invaluable for:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-200 leading-relaxed ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><span class="font-semibold">Statistical Mechanics:</span> Simulating systems with many interacting particles to understand thermodynamic properties (e.g., phase transitions in materials like the Ising model for ferromagnetism).</li>

            <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
                The strength of Monte Carlo lies in its ability to handle very high-dimensional integrals and complex boundary conditions, making it a versatile tool for problems where deterministic methods are impractical.
