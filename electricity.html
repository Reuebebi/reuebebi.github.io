            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Welcome to the electrifying realm of <span class="key-term">Electricity</span>, a cornerstone of modern technology and a fundamental force of nature. From the simple static cling that sticks clothes together in a dryer to the complex circuitry of a smartphone, and from the lightning bolts in a storm to the power grids that light up our cities, electricity is an ubiquitous and essential phenomenon. Understanding electricity is not just about powering devices; it's about comprehending the very fabric of matter and its interactions.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                At its most basic level, electricity arises from the properties of <span class="key-term">electric charge</span> – a fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. This lesson will begin by defining electric charge, distinguishing between positive and negative charges, and introducing <span class="key-term">Coulomb's Law</span>, which quantifies the force between static charges. We will then expand our understanding to include <span class="key-term">electric fields</span>, which mediate these forces, and <span class="key-term">electric potential</span> (voltage), which describes the potential energy associated with charge in a field.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Our journey will then move from static electricity to the flow of charge: <span class="key-term">electric current</span>. We'll explore the concepts of <span class="key-term">voltage</span> (the "push" behind the current), and <span class="key-term">resistance</span> (the "opposition" to current flow). These three quantities are inextricably linked by the fundamental relationship known as <span class="key-term">Ohm's Law</span>. Finally, we will apply these principles to analyze and design simple electrical pathways, distinguishing between <span class="key-term">series and parallel circuits</span>, which are the building blocks of all electronic devices.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Whether you're a curious learner, an aspiring electrician, or a future engineer, this comprehensive lesson will equip you with the foundational knowledge of electricity. Prepare to unravel the invisible currents that power our interconnected world, from the atomic scale to the global grid!

            <h3 class="text-4xl mb-6">2. Electric Charge and Coulomb's Law</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The most fundamental concept in electricity is <span class="key-term">electric charge</span>. It is an intrinsic property of matter that causes it to experience a force when in the presence of other electric charges.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">2.1. Electric Charge ($q$)</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                There are two types of electric charge: <span class="key-term">positive (+)</span> and <span class="key-term">negative (-)</span>.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Like charges repel:</span> Positive charges repel positive charges, and negative charges repel negative charges.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Unlike charges attract:</span> Positive charges attract negative charges.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The elementary unit of charge is the magnitude of the charge of an electron or a proton, denoted by $e$:
            </p>
            <div class="math-equation">
                $$e \approx 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$
            </div>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                An electron has a charge of $-e$, and a proton has a charge of $+e$. The SI unit of electric charge is the <span class="key-term">Coulomb (C)</span>. One Coulomb is a very large amount of charge.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">2.2. Law of Conservation of Charge</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The <span class="key-term">Law of Conservation of Charge</span> states that the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero. Charge is neither created nor destroyed, but rather transferred from one object to another. For example, when you rub a balloon on your hair, charge is transferred from your hair to the balloon, making your hair positively charged and the balloon negatively charged, but the total net charge of the hair-balloon system remains zero.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">2.3. Coulomb's Law</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <span class="key-term">Coulomb's Law</span> quantifies the electrostatic force between two stationary, charged particles. It states that the force is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.
            </p>
            <div class="math-equation">
                $$F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$$
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
                    <li>$F$ is the magnitude of the <span class="key-term">electrostatic force</span> between the charges (in Newtons, N).</li>
                    <li>$k$ is <span class="key-term">Coulomb's constant</span>, approximately $8.9875 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$.</li>
                    <li>$|q_1|$ and $|q_2|$ are the magnitudes of the two <span class="key-term">electric charges</span> (in Coulombs, C).</li>
                    <li>$r$ is the <span class="key-term">distance</span> between the centers of the two charges (in meters, m).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The direction of the force is along the line connecting the two charges. If the charges are like, the force is repulsive; if unlike, it's attractive. This law is analogous to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, but for charges instead of masses.
            </p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Example: Coulomb's Law Calculation</h4>

                    Two point charges, $q_1 = +2.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$ and $q_2 = -3.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$, are separated by a distance of $0.5 \text{ m}$. Calculate the magnitude of the electrostatic force between them.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Using $F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$:
                    $$F = (8.9875 \times 10^9) \frac{|(2.0 \times 10^{-6})(-3.0 \times 10^{-6})|}{(0.5)^2}$$
                    $$F = (8.9875 \times 10^9) \frac{6.0 \times 10^{-12}}{0.25}$$
                    $$F = (8.9875 \times 10^9)(2.4 \times 10^{-11})$$
                    $$F \approx 0.216 \text{ N}$$
                    Since the charges are opposite, the force is attractive. The magnitude of the force is approximately $0.216 \text{ N}$.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Instead of thinking of forces directly between charges, physicists often use the concept of an <span class="key-term">electric field</span> to describe how charges interact.

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">3.1. Electric Field ($\vec{E}$)</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                An <span class="key-term">electric field</span> is a region around a charged particle or object where a force would be exerted on other charged particles or objects. It is a vector field, meaning it has both magnitude and direction at every point in space. The direction of the electric field at a point is defined as the direction of the force that a small positive "test charge" would experience if placed at that point.
