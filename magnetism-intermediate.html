                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    <span class="glossary-term">Magnetism</span> is a fundamental force of nature, closely related to electricity. Together, they form the bedrock of <span class="glossary-term">electromagnetism</span>, one of the four fundamental interactions of the universe. From the simple attraction of a magnet to a refrigerator door to the complex workings of electric motors, generators, and even the Earth's protective magnetic field, magnetism plays an indispensable role in our daily lives and the universe at large.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Historically, magnetism was observed in naturally occurring lodestones. However, it was only in the 19th century that scientists like Oersted, Ampere, Faraday, and Maxwell revealed the deep connection between electricity and magnetism, culminating in the unified theory of electromagnetism. This lesson will explore how magnetic fields are produced, how they interact with moving charges and currents, and some of their most significant applications.

                <h3 class="subsection-title">1.1 What is a Magnetic Field?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Just as an electric charge creates an electric field in the space around it, a moving electric charge (or a current) creates a <span class="glossary-term">magnetic field ($\vec{B}$)</span> in the space around it. Magnetic fields are vector fields, meaning they have both magnitude and direction at every point in space. We visualize magnetic fields using <span class="glossary-term">magnetic field lines</span>, which:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>Emerge from the North pole of a magnet and enter the South pole.</li>
                    <li>Never cross each other.</li>
                    <li>Are denser where the magnetic field is stronger.</li>
                    <li>Form continuous loops (unlike electric field lines, which start and end on charges).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The unit of magnetic field strength is the Tesla (T), or the smaller unit Gauss (G), where $1\, \text{T} = 10^4\, \text{G}$.

Basic definitions of flux and magnetic field lines with illustrative diagrams would also enhance this part.

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">2. Magnetic Fields Produced by Currents</h2>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    The profound discovery that electric currents produce magnetic fields was made by Hans Christian Oersted in 1820. This revelation opened the door to understanding electromagnetism and paved the way for technologies like electric motors. We use two fundamental laws to calculate the magnetic fields generated by different current configurations: the Biot-Savart Law and Ampere's Law.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">2.1 The Biot-Savart Law</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The <span class="glossary-term">Biot-Savart Law</span> is a fundamental equation that describes the magnetic field ($\vec{dB}$) produced by an infinitesimal segment of current ($I\vec{dl}$). It is analogous to Coulomb's Law for electric fields produced by point charges.
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\vec{dB} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{I\vec{dl} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}$$
                </div>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>$\vec{dB}$: Infinitesimal magnetic field vector produced by the current segment (in Tesla, T).</li>
                    <li>$\mu_0$: The <span class="glossary-term">permeability of free space</span>, a fundamental constant ($\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\, \text{T}\cdot\text{m/A}$).</li>
                    <li>$I$: Magnitude of the current (in Amperes, A).</li>
                    <li>$\vec{dl}$: A vector representing the infinitesimal length of the current path, in the direction of the current.</li>
                    <li>$\hat{r}$: A unit vector pointing from the current segment to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.</li>
                    <li>$r$: Distance from the current segment to the point of interest.</li>
                    <li>$\times$: Indicates a vector (cross) product, meaning the direction of $\vec{dB}$ is perpendicular to both $\vec{dl}$ and $\hat{r}$.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    To find the total magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) from a current distribution, one must integrate $\vec{dB}$ over the entire current path. While general, the integral can be complex.
                </p>
                <h4 class="concept-title">Magnetic Field of a Long Straight Wire:</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    One of the most common applications of the Biot-Savart Law (or Ampere's Law) is to find the magnetic field around a long, straight wire carrying current. The field lines form concentric circles around the wire.
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$$
                </div>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Where $r$ is the perpendicular distance from the wire. The direction is given by the <span class="glossary-term">Right-Hand Rule for Wires</span>: Point your right thumb in the direction of the current, and your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">2.2 Ampere's Law</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    <span class="glossary-term">Ampere's Law</span> provides an alternative, often simpler, method for calculating magnetic fields, especially for situations with high degrees of symmetry (like long wires, solenoids, and toroids). It relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through that loop.
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dl} = \mu_0 I_{enc}$$
                </div>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>$\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dl}$: This is a line integral of the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ around a closed path (called an <span class="glossary-term">Amperian loop</span>). The dot product $\vec{B} \cdot \vec{dl}$ means we only consider the component of $\vec{B}$ parallel to the path segment.</li>
                    <li>$\mu_0$: Permeability of free space.</li>
                    <li>$I_{enc}$: The total net current enclosed by the Amperian loop. Currents passing through the loop in the direction of the right-hand rule (curling fingers along the loop, thumb in current direction) are positive; those in the opposite direction are negative.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Ampere's Law is particularly powerful for situations where the magnetic field is constant in magnitude and parallel to the chosen Amperian loop, allowing the integral to simplify greatly.
                </p>
                <h4 class="concept-title">Magnetic Field of a Solenoid:</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    A <span class="glossary-term">solenoid</span> is a tightly wound coil of wire that produces a remarkably uniform magnetic field inside it when current flows. Using Ampere's Law, the magnetic field inside an ideal long solenoid is:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$B = \mu_0 n I$$
                </div>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Where $n$ is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid ($N/L$). The field outside an ideal solenoid is approximately zero. This uniform field makes solenoids crucial components in electromagnets and many scientific instruments.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p class="font-bold mb-2">Example 1: Magnetic Field inside a Solenoid</p>
                    <p>A solenoid has $500$ turns over a length of $0.2\, \text{m}$ and carries a current of $3.0\, \text{A}$. What is the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid?</p>
                    <p>Given: $N = 500$, $L = 0.2\, \text{m}$, $I = 3.0\, \text{A}$.</p>
                    <p>First, calculate turns per unit length: $n = \frac{N}{L} = \frac{500}{0.2\, \text{m}} = 2500\, \text{turns/m}$.</p>
