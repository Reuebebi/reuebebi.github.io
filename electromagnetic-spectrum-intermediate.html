            <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-blue-300 mb-6">1. Introduction to the Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Welcome to <strong class="text-blue-200">Whizmath</strong>! When you think of light, you probably imagine the vibrant colors we see every day. However, visible light is just a tiny sliver of a much grander phenomenon known as the <strong class="text-blue-200">Electromagnetic (EM) Spectrum</strong>. The EM spectrum encompasses all forms of electromagnetic radiation, which are disturbances that propagate through space, carrying energy.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                From the radio waves that carry your favorite music to the gamma rays emitted by distant cosmic events, all these forms of radiation are fundamentally the same: they are composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that travel at the speed of light. They differ only in their wavelength, frequency, and consequently, their energy.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Understanding the electromagnetic spectrum is crucial in physics, astronomy, technology, and even everyday life. It explains how radios work, how microwave ovens heat food, how night vision goggles see in the dark, how X-rays image bones, and how telescopes observe the most distant galaxies. Each part of the spectrum provides a unique window into the universe around us.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                In this lesson, we will embark on a journey across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, exploring each major type of radiation, from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays. We'll examine their properties, how they are generated, and their diverse applications, unveiling the invisible forces that shape our world.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-blue-300 mb-6">2. What is Electromagnetic Radiation?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                At its core, <strong class="text-blue-200">electromagnetic radiation</strong> is a form of energy that travels through space as waves and can also behave as particles (photons). It doesn't require a medium to propagate, which is why sunlight can travel through the vacuum of space to reach Earth.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">2.1 The Nature of EM Waves</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Electromagnetic waves are unique because they are self-propagating oscillations of electric and magnetic fields.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-4 text-lg">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Transverse Waves:</strong> The oscillations of the electric field and the magnetic field are perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Interdependent Fields:</strong> A changing electric field produces a changing magnetic field, and vice versa. This continuous interplay allows the wave to sustain itself and travel through space.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Speed of Light:</strong> All forms of electromagnetic radiation travel at the same constant speed in a vacuum, known as the <strong class="text-blue-200">speed of light ($c$)</strong>, approximately $3 \times 10^8 \text{ meters per second}$.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                These properties were mathematically described by <strong class="text-blue-200">James Clerk Maxwell's equations</strong> in the 19th century, which unified electricity, magnetism, and light into a single theory.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">2.2 Generation of EM Radiation</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Electromagnetic waves are generated by the acceleration of charged particles.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-4 text-lg">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Oscillating Charges:</strong> In an antenna, electrons are made to oscillate back and forth, creating changing electric and magnetic fields that radiate outwards as radio waves.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Electron Transitions:</strong> When electrons in atoms jump between energy levels, they emit or absorb photons, which are quanta of electromagnetic radiation. This accounts for visible light, UV, and X-rays.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Nuclear Processes:</strong> Gamma rays are produced by nuclear reactions or radioactive decay, involving changes within the atomic nucleus.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Thermal Motion:</strong> All objects above absolute zero emit thermal radiation (primarily infrared) due to the random motion and collisions of their charged particles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                The way in which electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter depends strongly on its wavelength and frequency.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="properties" class="bg-gray-900 bg-opacity-80 p-8 rounded-xl shadow-xl mb-12 animate-fade-in">
            <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-blue-300 mb-6">3. Key Properties: Wavelength, Frequency, and Energy</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                While all electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, they are categorized by three fundamental interrelated properties: <strong class="text-blue-200">wavelength, frequency, and energy</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">3.1 Wavelength ($\lambda$)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                The <strong class="text-blue-200">wavelength ($\lambda$)</strong> is the spatial period of the wave—the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It is the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs of the wave. Wavelength is typically measured in meters (m), but can also be expressed in nanometers (nm), micrometers ($\mu m$), or even picometers (pm) depending on the part of the spectrum.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">3.2 Frequency ($\nu$ or $f$)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                The <strong class="text-blue-200">frequency ($\nu$ or $f$)</strong> is the number of wave cycles that pass a fixed point per unit of time. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz), where $1 \text{ Hz}$ equals one cycle per second.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional for electromagnetic waves traveling in a vacuum, related by the constant speed of light ($c$):
                $$ c = \lambda \nu $$
                This means that as wavelength increases, frequency decreases, and vice versa.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">3.3 Energy ($E$)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                In quantum mechanics, electromagnetic radiation also exhibits particle-like properties, where energy is carried in discrete packets called <strong class="text-blue-200">photons</strong>. The energy of a single photon is directly proportional to its frequency (and inversely proportional to its wavelength):
                $$ E = h\nu $$
                or, using $c=\lambda\nu \implies \nu = c/\lambda$:
                $$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$
                where:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-2 text-lg">
                    <li>$E$ is the energy of the photon (in Joules, J, or electronvolts, eV).</li>
                    <li>$h$ is <strong class="text-blue-200">Planck's constant</strong> ($6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J} \cdot \text{s}$).</li>
                    <li>$\nu$ is the frequency.</li>
                    <li>$c$ is the speed of light.</li>
                    <li>$\lambda$ is the wavelength.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                This relationship is crucial: higher frequency (shorter wavelength) electromagnetic radiation means higher energy photons. This has significant implications for how different parts of the spectrum interact with matter, especially living tissue.
            </p>

                This spectrum is not just an abstract concept; it is the invisible foundation upon which much of our modern technology is built, and it provides scientists with crucial tools to explore the farthest reaches of the universe and the innermost secrets of matter. Each band of the spectrum offers a unique lens through which to observe, understand, and interact with the world and the cosmos.
