                    Mechanics is the oldest and most fundamental branch of physics, dedicated to understanding the motion of objects and the forces that cause them to move or remain at rest. It's the bedrock upon which much of modern science and engineering is built, providing the principles necessary to analyze everything from the simple act of walking to the complex trajectories of spacecraft. Classical mechanics, primarily based on Isaac Newton's laws, successfully describes motion at scales ranging from subatomic particles to astronomical bodies, as long as speeds are well below the speed of light.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    This deep dive into mechanics will systematically explore its core concepts. We'll begin with the foundational principles laid out by Newton, then investigate various types of forces that influence motion. We'll also extend our analysis to situations where simple intuitions might fail, such as motion in accelerating reference frames. Finally, we'll shift our focus from linear motion to the fascinating world of rotational dynamics, uncovering the principles that govern spinning objects and circular paths.

                    At its most basic, <span class="glossary-term">motion</span> refers to a change in position over time. In mechanics, we describe motion using concepts such as <span class="glossary-term">displacement</span> (change in position), <span class="glossary-term">velocity</span> (rate of change of displacement), and <span class="glossary-term">acceleration</span> (rate of change of velocity). These quantities are vectors, meaning they have both magnitude and direction.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    A <span class="glossary-term">force ($\vec{F}$)</span> is a push or a pull exerted on an object. Forces cause objects to accelerate, deform, or change their state of motion. Forces are vector quantities, characterized by both magnitude and direction, and are measured in Newtons (N).

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Sir Isaac Newton's three laws of motion, published in his *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in 1687, revolutionized our understanding of the physical world. These laws describe the fundamental relationship between an object and the forces acting upon it, and the object's subsequent response. They are the bedrock of classical dynamics.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">2.1 Newton's First Law: The Law of Inertia</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Newton's First Law states: "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force." This law defines a special class of reference frames called <span class="glossary-term">inertial frames of reference</span>. An inertial frame is one in which Newton's first law holds true; it is either at rest or moving with a constant velocity relative to a distant star.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li><span class="glossary-term">Inertia:</span> The intrinsic property of an object to resist changes in its state of motion (i.e., its velocity). Mass is a quantitative measure of inertia.</li>
                    <li><span class="glossary-term">Unbalanced Force (Net Force):</span> The vector sum of all external forces acting on an object. If this sum is zero, the object's velocity is constant ($\vec{a} = 0$).</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\sum \vec{F} = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \vec{a} = 0$$
                </div>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    This law essentially states that no force is needed to maintain motion at a constant velocity, only to change it. This was a profound departure from Aristotelian physics, which held that a continuous force was required to keep an object moving.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">2.2 Newton's Second Law: Force, Mass, and Acceleration</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Newton's Second Law is the most quantitative and widely used of the three laws. It states: "The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to its mass."
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Mathematically, this is expressed as:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$$
                </div>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>$\sum \vec{F}$ is the <span class="glossary-term">net force</span> (vector sum of all external forces) acting on the object (measured in Newtons, N).</li>
                    <li>$m$ is the <span class="glossary-term">mass</span> of the object (measured in kilograms, kg).</li>
                    <li>$\vec{a}$ is the <span class="glossary-term">acceleration</span> of the object (measured in meters per second squared, m/s$^2$).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    One Newton is defined as the force required to accelerate a 1-kilogram mass by 1 meter per second squared ($1\, \text{N} = 1\, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}^2$). This law is the foundation for solving almost any problem involving forces and motion. When applying this law, it's crucial to draw a free-body diagram to identify all forces acting on the object.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p class="font-bold mb-2">Example 1: Pushing a Crate</p>
                    <p>A $50\, \text{kg}$ crate is pushed across a frictionless floor with a net horizontal force of $150\, \text{N}$. What is the acceleration of the crate?</p>
                    <p>Given: $m = 50\, \text{kg}$, $\sum F = 150\, \text{N}$</p>
                    <p>Using Newton's Second Law: $\sum F = ma$</p>
                    <p>$150\, \text{N} = (50\, \text{kg}) \cdot a$</p>
                    <p>$a = \frac{150\, \text{N}}{50\, \text{kg}} = 3.0\, \text{m/s}^2$</p>
                    <p>The crate accelerates at $3.0\, \text{m/s}^2$ in the direction of the net force.</p>

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Newton's Third Law states: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." This means that whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the first.
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\vec{F}_{AB} = -\vec{F}_{BA}$$

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>$\vec{F}_{AB}$: Force exerted by object A on object B.</li>
                    <li>$\vec{F}_{BA}$: Force exerted by object B on object A.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    It is crucial to remember that action-reaction forces always act on *different* objects. They never cancel each other out because they are not acting on the same system. For example, when you push a wall, the wall pushes back on you with an equal and opposite force. Your push on the wall and the wall's push on you constitute an action-reaction pair. This law explains propulsion (e.g., rockets pushing exhaust gases backward, gases pushing the rocket forward) and how we walk (we push the ground backward, the ground pushes us forward).

                    While Newton's Laws provide the framework, a deeper understanding of specific types of forces is essential for analyzing real-world scenarios. Here, we'll examine some of the most common and important forces you'll encounter in mechanics.

                    The <span class="glossary-term">gravitational force ($\vec{F}_g$)</span>, often simply called <span class="glossary-term">weight</span>, is the attractive force exerted by a massive body (like Earth) on another object. Near the Earth's surface, this force is directed towards the center of the Earth and its magnitude is:

                    The <span class="glossary-term">normal force ($\vec{F}_N$)</span> is a contact force exerted by a surface on an object in contact with it, acting perpendicular to the surface. It is the force that prevents an object from passing through the surface. Its magnitude adjusts itself to prevent penetration.

                    <span class="glossary-term">Friction ($\vec{f}$)</span> is a pervasive force that opposes the relative motion (or attempted relative motion) between surfaces in contact. It arises from the microscopic irregularities of surfaces and intermolecular adhesive forces. Friction is always parallel to the contact surface.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    <span class="glossary-term">Drag force ($\vec{F}_D$)</span> is a resistive force exerted by a fluid (liquid or gas) on an object moving through it. Unlike friction, which is primarily due to surface roughness, drag arises from collisions with fluid molecules and the pressure differences created by the object's motion.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The drag force depends on several factors:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>The object's speed ($v$).</li>
                    <li>The object's shape and orientation (quantified by the <span class="glossary-term">drag coefficient, $C$</span>).</li>
                    <li>The fluid's density ($\rho$).</li>
                    <li>The object's cross-sectional area ($A$) perpendicular to the flow.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    For speeds typically encountered in everyday situations (and for large objects), the drag force is approximately proportional to the square of the speed:

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    As an object falls through a fluid, the drag force increases with its speed. Eventually, the drag force can become equal in magnitude to the gravitational force. At this point, the net force on the object is zero, and it stops accelerating, reaching a constant velocity called <span class="glossary-term">terminal velocity ($v_t$)</span>.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    As established, Newton's Laws are strictly valid only in inertial frames of reference. However, many real-world situations involve observations from <span class="glossary-term">non-inertial frames</span> – that is, reference frames that are accelerating relative to an inertial frame. Examples include a car accelerating, an elevator moving up or down with changing speed, or a merry-go-round.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    When applying Newton's Second Law ($\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$) in a non-inertial frame, observers often perceive "forces" that don't correspond to any actual physical interaction (like gravity, tension, or friction). These are called <span class="glossary-term">fictitious forces</span> (or inertial forces). They are not real forces but are introduced to make Newton's Second Law mathematically consistent in an accelerating frame.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">4.1 Accelerating Linear Frames</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Consider an object inside an elevator that is accelerating upwards. From the perspective of an observer inside the elevator (a non-inertial frame), an object placed on a scale might appear heavier than its actual weight. To apply Newton's Second Law in this frame, we would introduce a downward fictitious force, equal to $-m\vec{a}_{frame}$, where $\vec{a}_{frame}$ is the acceleration of the non-inertial frame relative to an inertial one.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The apparent force ($F_{apparent}$) on an object of mass $m$ in a linearly accelerating frame is given by:

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The term $-m\vec{a}_{frame}$ is the fictitious force.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Rotating frames of reference are particularly interesting because they introduce two common fictitious forces: the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force.
                </p>
                <h4 class="concept-title">4.2.1 Centrifugal Force</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    When an object is observed in a rotating frame, it appears to be pushed outward from the center of rotation. This outward push is attributed to the <span class="glossary-term">centrifugal force</span>. It's not a real force; rather, it's the inertia of the object trying to move in a straight line while the frame of reference itself is curving. Its magnitude is $F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} = m\omega^2 r$, and it acts radially outward.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    For example, if you are in a car taking a sharp turn, you feel "pushed" outward. This is the centrifugal force, a fictitious force in your non-inertial (accelerating) frame. From an inertial frame, you are simply trying to continue in a straight line while the car turns under you.
                </p>

                <h4 class="concept-title">4.2.2 Coriolis Force</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The <span class="glossary-term">Coriolis force</span> appears to act on objects moving within a rotating frame, causing a deflection perpendicular to both the object's velocity and the axis of rotation. Its magnitude depends on the object's mass, its velocity relative to the rotating frame, and the angular velocity of the frame.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The Coriolis effect is responsible for large-scale phenomena on Earth, such as the rotation of hurricanes and ocean currents, where it deflects moving air and water masses. It also affects the trajectory of long-range projectiles and explains why Foucault pendulums appear to rotate.

                    <p>An observer watching from above (inertial frame) would see the ball travel in a straight line, while the merry-go-round rotates beneath it. The apparent curvature is due to the observer's own rotating frame of reference.</p>
