                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Welcome to <span class="font-semibold text-white">Whizmath</span>'s comprehensive study of <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Sound Intensity & Decibels</span>! Sound is a pervasive part of our environment, enabling communication, entertaining us with music, and alerting us to danger. While we intuitively understand "loudness," scientifically quantifying sound and its effects requires precise measurement and understanding of how sound energy propagates and interacts with its surroundings.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    From the gentle rustle of leaves to the roar of a jet engine, sound levels vary enormously. Our ears are remarkably sensitive, capable of detecting sounds across a vast range of intensities. To manage this wide range effectively, a logarithmic scale, the <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">decibel scale</span>, is used to quantify sound levels in a way that aligns with human perception.

            <!-- Section 1: Sound as a Wave and Its Power -->
            <section class="bg-gray-800 bg-opacity-70 rounded-2xl p-10 shadow-xl border border-gray-700 transition duration-300 ease-in-out hover:shadow-2xl">
                <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-6 border-b-2 border-blue-500 pb-3">Sound as a Wave and Its Power</h2>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Sound is a <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">mechanical wave</span> that travels through a medium by causing particles of the medium to oscillate. It is typically a <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">longitudinal wave</span>, meaning the oscillations of the medium's particles are parallel to the direction of wave propagation.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Sound and Energy Transfer</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Like all waves, sound waves carry <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">energy</span> from a source to a receiver. As sound propagates, it causes vibrations in the medium, transferring kinetic and potential energy to the particles. The louder the sound, the more energy it carries.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Sound Power ($P$)</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">sound power ($P$)</span> of a source is the total amount of sound energy emitted by the source per unit time. It is a fundamental property of the source itself, independent of distance or environment.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        <li>Unit: Watt (W), where $1 \text{ W} = 1 \text{ Joule/second (J/s)}$.</li>
                        <li>A sound source might have a power output of a few microwatts for a quiet whisper to hundreds of watts for a loud speaker system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Sound Intensity ($I$)</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Sound intensity ($I$)</span> is the average rate at which sound energy flows through a unit area perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. It quantifies how much sound power is concentrated in a given area. It's what our ears primarily perceive as loudness.
                    $$ I = \frac{P}{A} $$
                    Where:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        <li>$I$: Sound intensity.</li>
                        <li>$P$: Sound power from the source.</li>
                        <li>$A$: Area over which the power is distributed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Unit:</span> The SI unit of sound intensity is Watts per square meter ($\text{W/m}^2$).
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        <li>The threshold of human hearing (the faintest sound a young, healthy ear can detect) is approximately $I_0 = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$.</li>
                        <li>The threshold of pain is around $1 \text{ W/m}^2$. This represents an enormous range of intensities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Relationship with Amplitude</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Sound intensity is proportional to the square of the sound wave's amplitude (specifically, the pressure amplitude or displacement amplitude).
                    $$ I \propto (\text{pressure amplitude})^2 \quad \text{or} \quad I \propto (\text{displacement amplitude})^2 $$
                    This means that a small increase in amplitude leads to a much larger increase in intensity.

                <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-6 border-b-2 border-blue-500 pb-3">The Decibel Scale: Quantifying Loudness</h2>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Because the range of sound intensities that the human ear can perceive is so vast (from $10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$ to $1 \text{ W/m}^2$, a factor of $10^{12}$), a linear scale is impractical. Instead, a logarithmic scale called the <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">decibel (dB) scale</span> is used. This scale compresses the enormous range of intensities into a more manageable set of numbers, and it also aligns better with how humans perceive loudness, which is logarithmic.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Sound Intensity Level ($\beta$)</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">sound intensity level ($\beta$)</span> in decibels is defined as:
                    $$ \beta = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right) $$
                    Where:

                        <li>$\beta$: Sound intensity level (in decibels, dB).</li>

                    For a point source emitting sound uniformly in all directions (isotropically) in an open, unbounded medium without reflections, the sound energy spreads out spherically. As the wavefront expands, the same amount of power is distributed over an increasingly larger area.

                    Consider a point source emitting sound with power $P$. At a distance $r$ from the source, the sound energy passes through a spherical surface with area $A = 4\pi r^2$.
                    The intensity $I$ at this distance is:
                    $$ I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2} $$
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This equation shows that sound intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source ($I \propto 1/r^2$).
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    If we have two distances, $r_1$ and $r_2$, from the same sound source, the intensities $I_1$ and $I_2$ at these distances are related by:
                    $$ I_1 r_1^2 = I_2 r_2^2 \quad \text{ or } \quad \frac{I_1}{I_2} = \left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^2 $$
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-300">In terms of Decibels:</span>
                    Since the decibel scale is logarithmic, the relationship for sound intensity levels at different distances is:
                    $$ \beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right) $$
                    Using the inverse square law, $\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \left(\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right)^2$, we get:
                    $$ \beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10 \log_{10}\left(\left(\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right)^2\right) $$
                    $$ \beta_2 - \beta_1 = 20 \log_{10}\left(\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right) $$
                    This means that for every doubling of distance, the sound intensity level drops by 6 dB ($20 \log_{10}(1/2) \approx -6 \text{ dB}$).
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Limitations and Real-World Factors</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The inverse square law is an idealization. In real-world environments, several factors can cause deviations:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Absorption:</span> The medium itself absorbs some sound energy, especially at higher frequencies.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Reflections:</span> Walls, ceilings, and other objects reflect sound, preventing it from spreading uniformly and often increasing intensity in certain areas (reverberation).</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Diffraction:</span> Sound waves bend around obstacles, distributing energy into shadowed regions.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Atmospheric Conditions:</span> Wind, temperature gradients, and humidity can affect sound propagation.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Directional Sources:</span> Many sound sources are not isotropic (e.g., a loudspeaker directs sound in a specific direction), which alters the energy distribution.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Despite these complexities, the inverse square law provides a fundamental understanding of how sound intensity generally behaves in free space and serves as a starting point for more complex acoustic modeling.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Resonance</span> is a phenomenon that occurs when an oscillating system (or an object with a natural frequency) is driven by an external force or wave at or near one of its natural frequencies. At resonance, the system absorbs energy most efficiently, leading to a dramatic increase in the amplitude of its oscillations.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Natural Frequency</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Every object or system capable of oscillating has one or more <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">natural frequencies</span> (also called resonant frequencies or eigenfrequencies). These are the frequencies at which the object will oscillate freely if disturbed and then left alone. For example, a pendulum has a natural frequency determined by its length, and a guitar string has natural frequencies determined by its length, tension, and mass.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">The Resonance Phenomenon</h3>

                    <li>When an external periodic force (or wave) acts on a system, if the frequency of this driving force matches a natural frequency of the system, <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">resonance occurs</span>.</li>
                    <li>At resonance, the system effectively "stores" the energy from the driving force, and the amplitude of its oscillations grows significantly.</li>
                    <li>If damping (energy dissipation) is low, the amplitude can become very large.</li>
