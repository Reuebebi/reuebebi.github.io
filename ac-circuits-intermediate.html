            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Welcome to <strong class="text-blue-200">Whizmath</strong>! In previous lessons, you might have encountered <strong class="text-blue-200">Direct Current (DC)</strong> circuits, where current flows in one constant direction. While DC is essential for battery-powered devices and digital electronics, the world outside your small devices, including your home's power outlets and the global power grid, is dominated by <strong class="text-blue-200">Alternating Current (AC)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                AC is characterized by current and voltage that periodically reverse direction and vary in magnitude, typically following a sinusoidal pattern. This seemingly simple change from constant to alternating flow opens up a completely new and fascinating realm of circuit behavior, involving components like inductors and capacitors in ways that DC circuits cannot emulate.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Understanding AC circuits is crucial for anyone interested in electrical engineering, electronics, or even just understanding how the power in your home works. AC allows for efficient power transmission over long distances using transformers, forms the basis of radio communication, and is integral to countless electronic devices, from filters to oscillators.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                In this lesson, we will lay the foundation for comprehending AC circuits. We'll start by defining AC voltage and current, then explore how familiar components like resistors behave differently, and introduce new concepts like <strong class="text-blue-200">reactance</strong> for inductors and capacitors. Finally, we'll examine simple combinations of these components in series (RL, RC, and RLC circuits), paving the way for more advanced circuit analysis. Prepare to unlock the dynamic world of alternating current!

            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Unlike DC, where voltage and current are constant, <strong class="text-blue-200">AC voltage</strong> and <strong class="text-blue-200">AC current</strong> continuously change their magnitude and periodically reverse their direction. The most common form of AC is a sinusoidal wave.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">2.1 Sinusoidal AC Waveforms</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                A sinusoidal AC voltage or current can be mathematically described as:
                $$ v(t) = V_{\text{peak}} \sin(\omega t + \phi_v) $$
                $$ i(t) = I_{\text{peak}} \sin(\omega t + \phi_i) $$
                where:

                    <li>$v(t)$ and $i(t)$ are the instantaneous voltage and current at time $t$.</li>
                    <li>$V_{\text{peak}}$ and $I_{\text{peak}}$ are the <strong class="text-blue-200">peak (or maximum) voltage and current</strong>, respectively.</li>
                    <li>$\omega$ (omega) is the <strong class="text-blue-200">angular frequency</strong>, measured in radians per second (rad/s).</li>
                    <li>$\phi_v$ and $\phi_i$ are the <strong class="text-blue-200">phase angles</strong> (or phase shifts) for voltage and current, respectively, indicating their starting point in the cycle relative to a reference.</li>

            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">2.2 Key Parameters of AC Waveforms</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-4 text-lg">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Frequency ($f$):</strong> The number of complete cycles per second. Measured in Hertz (Hz).
                    $$ f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} $$
                    In North America, standard AC frequency is $60 \text{ Hz}$; in Europe and many other parts of the world, it's $50 \text{ Hz}$.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Period ($T$):</strong> The time taken for one complete cycle. It's the reciprocal of frequency.
                    $$ T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} $$
                    Measured in seconds (s).</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Phase (Angle $\phi$):</strong> Represents the position of a point on the waveform cycle. The phase difference between voltage and current is crucial in AC circuits.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong class="text-blue-200">Root Mean Square (RMS) Value:</strong> Since AC voltage and current continuously change, we need a way to quantify their "effective" value for power calculations. The RMS value is equivalent to the DC value that would produce the same heating effect in a resistive load.
                    For a sinusoidal waveform:
                    $$ V_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707 V_{\text{peak}} $$
                    $$ I_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{I_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707 I_{\text{peak}} $$
                    The voltage values typically quoted for household electricity (e.g., $120 \text{ V}$ or $230 \text{ V}$) are RMS values.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Understanding these fundamental parameters is the first step to analyzing the behavior of different components in an AC environment.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-blue-300 mb-6">3. Resistors in AC Circuits: Purely Resistive Behavior</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                A <strong class="text-blue-200">resistor</strong> is the simplest component to analyze in an AC circuit because its behavior is straightforward and identical to its behavior in DC circuits, except that the voltage and current values are continuously changing.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">3.1 Ohm's Law for Resistors in AC</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                When an AC voltage is applied across a resistor, the current through it is still governed by <strong class="text-blue-200">Ohm's Law</strong>. If the instantaneous voltage is $v(t) = V_{\text{peak}} \sin(\omega t)$, then the instantaneous current $i(t)$ is:
                $$ i(t) = \frac{v(t)}{R} = \frac{V_{\text{peak}}}{R} \sin(\omega t) $$
                So, $I_{\text{peak}} = V_{\text{peak}}/R$. We can also express this in terms of RMS values:
                $$ I_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_{\text{RMS}}}{R} $$
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">3.2 Phase Relationship: In Phase</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                The most important characteristic of a resistor in an AC circuit is the <strong class="text-blue-200">phase relationship between voltage and current</strong>. For a purely resistive circuit, the voltage across the resistor and the current through it are always <strong class="text-blue-200">in phase</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-4 text-lg">
                <li class="mb-2">This means that they reach their peak values, zero values, and minimum values at the same instant in time. There is no phase shift between them ($\phi_v - \phi_i = 0$).</li>
                <li class="mb-2">When voltage is maximum positive, current is maximum positive. When voltage is zero, current is zero. When voltage is maximum negative, current is maximum negative.</li>

                Resistors dissipate electrical energy as heat. In an AC circuit, the instantaneous power $p(t) = v(t) \cdot i(t)$. Since voltage and current are in phase, the power is always positive (or zero), meaning energy is continuously dissipated.
                The average power dissipated by a resistor in an AC circuit is given by:
                $$ P_{\text{avg}} = V_{\text{RMS}} I_{\text{RMS}} = I_{\text{RMS}}^2 R = \frac{V_{\text{RMS}}^2}{R} $$
                This is identical to the power formula for DC circuits, confirming that RMS values are indeed the "effective" values for power calculations.

                While resistors behave simply, inductors and capacitors introduce new concepts: reactance and phase shifts, which are central to AC circuit analysis.

                An <strong class="text-blue-200">inductor</strong> is a passive electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when current flows through it. In DC circuits, an ideal inductor acts like a short circuit once the current stabilizes. However, in AC circuits, its behavior is profoundly different due to the constantly changing current, which induces a back electromotive force (EMF).

            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                In AC circuits, an inductor opposes changes in current. This opposition to AC current is called <strong class="text-blue-200">inductive reactance</strong>, denoted by $X_L$. It is measured in Ohms ($\Omega$), just like resistance, but it is not a resistance because it doesn't dissipate energy. Instead, it temporarily stores energy in its magnetic field.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                The formula for inductive reactance is:
                $$ X_L = \omega L = 2\pi f L $$
                where:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-2 text-lg">

                <li class="mb-2">As the frequency $f$ increases, $X_L$ increases. This means inductors offer more opposition to higher frequency AC signals.</li>

            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                The most critical characteristic of an inductor in an AC circuit is the <strong class="text-blue-200">phase relationship between voltage and current</strong>. For a purely inductive circuit, the voltage across the inductor <strong class="text-blue-200">leads</strong> the current through it by $90^\circ$ ($\pi/2$ radians).

            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                This means that the voltage across the inductor reaches its peak value a quarter of a cycle before the current reaches its peak value. This phase difference is due to the inductor's opposition to changes in current; it takes time for the current to build up in response to the applied voltage.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                While inductors offer opposition to current, they do not dissipate average power over a full cycle in an ideal AC circuit. The energy stored in the magnetic field during one quarter cycle is returned to the circuit in the next quarter cycle. This is related to the concept of reactive power, which we'll discuss later.

                A key feature of the RLC series circuit is <strong class="text-blue-200">series resonance</strong>. Resonance occurs when the inductive reactance perfectly cancels out the capacitive reactance ($X_L = X_C$). At this <strong class="text-blue-200">resonant frequency</strong> ($\omega_0$ or $f_0$), the impedance of the circuit is at its minimum, equal to just the resistance $R$.
                $$ \omega_0 L = \frac{1}{\omega_0 C} \implies \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} $$
                At resonance, the current in the circuit reaches its maximum value for a given voltage, and the circuit behaves like a purely resistive circuit (voltage and current are in phase). This property is fundamental to tuning circuits in radios and other communication systems.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                The amount of resistance $R$ in the circuit determines the <strong class="text-blue-200">damping</strong> of the resonance. A smaller $R$ means less damping, a sharper and higher resonance peak (higher Q-factor), and better frequency selectivity.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                RLC circuits are the workhorses of many electronic applications, from filters and oscillators to tuning circuits and impedance matching networks.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-blue-300 mb-6">9. Power in AC Circuits: Real, Reactive, Apparent</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                In AC circuits containing reactive components (inductors and capacitors), the concept of power is more nuanced than in DC circuits. We distinguish between three types of power: <strong class="text-blue-200">real power, reactive power, and apparent power</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">9.1 Real Power ($P$)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Also known as <strong class="text-blue-200">active power</strong> or <strong class="text-blue-200">average power</strong>, this is the actual power dissipated by the circuit as heat or converted into useful work (e.g., light from a bulb, mechanical power from a motor). Real power is only dissipated by the resistive components.
                $$ P = V_{\text{RMS}} I_{\text{RMS}} \cos\phi $$
                where $\cos\phi$ is the <strong class="text-blue-200">power factor</strong>. Real power is measured in Watts (W).
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">9.2 Reactive Power ($Q$)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Reactive power is the power that continuously flows back and forth between the source and the reactive components (inductors and capacitors). It is stored in the magnetic fields of inductors and the electric fields of capacitors during one part of the cycle and returned to the source in another part. Reactive power does not perform any useful work or dissipate energy.
                $$ Q = V_{\text{RMS}} I_{\text{RMS}} \sin\phi $$
                Reactive power is measured in Volt-Amperes Reactive (VAR).
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">9.3 Apparent Power ($S$)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Apparent power is the product of the total RMS voltage and RMS current in the circuit. It represents the total power delivered by the source, without considering the phase difference between voltage and current.
                $$ S = V_{\text{RMS}} I_{\text{RMS}} $$
                Apparent power is measured in Volt-Amperes (VA).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                These three powers are related by the <strong class="text-blue-200">power triangle</strong>, similar to impedance:
                $$ S^2 = P^2 + Q^2 $$
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-300 mb-4">9.4 Power Factor ($\cos\phi$)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                The power factor is the cosine of the phase angle between voltage and current ($\cos\phi$). It ranges from 0 to 1 and indicates how effectively the electrical power is being converted into useful work.
                $$ \text{Power Factor} = \cos\phi = \frac{P}{S} $$
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-2 text-lg">
                    <li class="mb-1">For purely resistive circuits, $\phi = 0^\circ$, so $\cos\phi = 1$. All apparent power is real power.</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">For purely reactive circuits (ideal inductors or capacitors), $\phi = \pm 90^\circ$, so $\cos\phi = 0$. All apparent power is reactive power, and no real power is dissipated.</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">For general RLC circuits, $0 < \cos\phi < 1$. A higher power factor means more efficient use of power. Utilities often penalize industries with low power factors because it requires them to supply more apparent power than is actually consumed as real power.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
                Understanding these power concepts is crucial for designing efficient and cost-effective AC power systems.
