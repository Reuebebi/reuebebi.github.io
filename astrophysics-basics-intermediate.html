                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Stars are the fundamental building blocks of galaxies, brilliant spheres of plasma held together by their own gravity, generating energy through nuclear fusion. Their lives are a cosmic drama, from birth in vast gas clouds to spectacular deaths that enrich the universe with heavier elements.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Stellar Formation: From Dust to Star</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Stellar Nurseries (Nebulae):</span> Stars are born from dense clumps within giant molecular clouds (GMCs), which are cold, dark clouds of gas (mostly hydrogen and helium) and dust.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Gravitational Collapse:</span> A disturbance (e.g., a supernova shockwave, galactic collision) can cause a region in a GMC to become unstable and begin to collapse under its own gravity.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Protostar:</span> As the cloud collapses, it fragments into denser clumps. Each clump contracts and heats up, forming a protostar. It glows from gravitational energy release but hasn't started fusion yet.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">T Tauri Stars:</span> Young, pre-main-sequence stars that are still contracting and have strong stellar winds.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Main Sequence Ignition:</span> As the protostar continues to contract, its core temperature and pressure rise. When the core reaches about 10 million Kelvin, nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium begins. The outward pressure from fusion balances the inward pull of gravity, establishing <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">hydrostatic equilibrium</span>. The star enters the <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">main sequence</span>, where it spends most of its life.</li>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">The Main Sequence: A Star's Adult Life</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    During their main-sequence phase, stars are stable and primarily fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores. The star's mass determines its luminosity, temperature, size, and lifetime on the main sequence. More massive stars are hotter, brighter, and live much shorter lives due to their higher fusion rates.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Energy Generation:</span>

                                <li><span class="font-bold">Proton-Proton (PP) Chain:</span> Dominant in stars like our Sun (lower mass stars). Four hydrogen nuclei ($^1_1\text{H}$) fuse to form one helium nucleus ($^4_2\text{He}$), releasing energy, neutrinos, and positrons.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">CNO Cycle:</span> Dominant in more massive stars. Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen act as catalysts for the fusion of hydrogen into helium. This process is more efficient at higher temperatures.</li>

Main sequence stars form a distinct diagonal band on this diagram.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Spectral Classification:</span> Stars are classified by their spectral type (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) which corresponds to their surface temperature (O being hottest, M being coolest). Our Sun is a G-type star.</li>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    A star leaves the main sequence when it exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core. Its subsequent evolution depends critically on its initial mass.

                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Red Giant Phase:</span> After core hydrogen is depleted, fusion stops in the core. The core contracts and heats, igniting a hydrogen-burning shell around the core. This causes the outer layers of the star to expand dramatically and cool, becoming a <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">red giant</span>.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Helium Flash (for stars < 2.25 M☉):</span> The core continues to contract and heat until it reaches temperatures sufficient for helium fusion (into carbon and oxygen). In lower-mass stars, this ignition can be explosive.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Horizontal Branch:</span> After the helium flash, the star briefly stabilizes on the horizontal branch, fusing helium in its core and hydrogen in a shell.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB):</span> When core helium is exhausted, the star expands again, becoming an AGB star. It now has a degenerate carbon-oxygen core, a helium-burning shell, and a hydrogen-burning shell. These stars are highly unstable and pulsate.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Planetary Nebula:</span> The outer layers of the AGB star are gently expelled, forming an expanding shell of gas and dust called a <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">planetary nebula</span>. The remaining core is exposed.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">White Dwarf:</span> The exposed, extremely dense, hot core is a <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">white dwarf</span>. It no longer undergoes fusion and slowly cools and fades over billions of years.</li>

Their cores become hot enough to fuse progressively heavier elements (carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon) in successive shells around an inert core, forming an "onion-like" structure.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Iron Core Formation:</span> Fusion continues until an iron (Fe) core forms. Iron fusion does not release energy; it consumes energy.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Core Collapse Supernova (Type II):</span> Once the iron core forms, fusion stops, and the core rapidly collapses under its own gravity. This collapse is catastrophic, leading to a bounce that drives a massive shockwave outward. This explosion is a <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Type II Supernova</span>, briefly outshining an entire galaxy and forging elements heavier than iron.</li>

                    These two terms are often confused but are distinct and crucial for understanding stellar properties.

                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Luminosity ($L$):</span> The total amount of energy radiated by a star per unit time (its intrinsic power output).

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    For a star emitting light uniformly in all directions (isotropically), the light energy spreads out spherically. The apparent brightness ($b$) at a distance $d$ from a star with luminosity $L$ is given by the <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">inverse square law</span>:
                    $$ b = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2} $$

                    This formula is incredibly powerful. If we can determine a star's intrinsic luminosity ($L$) (e.g., from its spectral type or by knowing it's a standard candle) and we measure its apparent brightness ($b$), we can then calculate its distance ($d$).
                    $$ d = \sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi b}} $$

                    The <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Stefan-Boltzmann Law</span> relates a star's luminosity ($L$) to its surface temperature ($T$) and radius ($R$). It assumes the star radiates like a perfect blackbody.
                    $$ L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 $$

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This equation shows that:

                        <li>Luminosity increases with the square of the radius.</li>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Cosmology</span> is the study of the origin, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe. The prevailing model is the Big Bang theory.

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">The Big Bang Theory</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Big Bang theory</span> is the leading cosmological model describing the universe's early rapid expansion from an extremely hot, dense state. It is not an explosion *in* space, but an expansion *of* space itself.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Key Evidence:</span>
                            <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-5 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                                <li><span class="font-bold">Expansion of the Universe (Hubble's Law):</span> Almost all galaxies are observed to be moving away from us, and the farther away they are, the faster they are receding.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation:</span> A faint glow of microwave radiation coming from all directions in space. This is the "afterglow" of the Big Bang, dating back to about 380,000 years after the Big Bang when the universe became transparent. It is incredibly uniform but contains tiny temperature fluctuations that seeded the formation of large-scale structure.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">Abundance of Light Elements:</span> The observed cosmic abundances of light elements (hydrogen, helium, lithium) perfectly match the predictions from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which occurred in the first few minutes after the Big Bang.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Expansion of the Universe: Hubble's Law</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In the late 1920s, Edwin Hubble observed that galaxies are generally receding from us, and their recession velocity is proportional to their distance. This relationship is known as <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Hubble's Law</span>:
                    $$ v = H_0 d $$
                    Where:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        <li>$v$: Recession velocity of the galaxy.</li>
                        <li>$H_0$: Hubble Constant (approximately $67-74 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$). It represents the current expansion rate of the universe.</li>
                        <li>$d$: Proper distance to the galaxy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The Hubble constant implies a "Hubble time" of approximately 13.8 billion years, which is the estimated age of the universe.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">The Accelerating Universe and its Fate</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Unexpectedly, in the late 1990s, observations of distant Type Ia supernovae showed that the universe's expansion is not slowing down (as expected due to gravity) but is actually <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">accelerating</span>. This acceleration is attributed to <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">dark energy</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The ultimate fate of the universe depends on the balance between its total energy density (matter + dark matter + dark energy) and its critical density:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Big Crunch (Closed Universe):</span> If the universe had enough matter/energy, gravity would eventually halt the expansion and cause it to contract back into a singularity. (Currently disfavored).</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Big Freeze / Heat Death (Open Universe):</span> If the universe had insufficient matter/energy, it would expand forever, cooling and becoming increasingly diffuse, eventually reaching a state of maximum entropy.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Big Rip:</span> A hypothetical scenario where dark energy becomes so strong that it eventually tears apart galaxies, stars, and even atoms. (Less favored than Big Freeze).</li>
                    </ul>
                    Given the dominance of dark energy and the accelerating expansion, the current consensus is that the universe will likely continue to expand indefinitely, leading to a <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">Big Freeze / Heat Death</span>.
