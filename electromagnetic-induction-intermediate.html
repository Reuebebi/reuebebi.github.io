                    <span class="glossary-term">Electromagnetic Induction</span> is a fundamental phenomenon that describes how a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current (or, more precisely, an electromotive force, EMF) in a conductor. This discovery, primarily attributed to Michael Faraday in 1831 (and independently by Joseph Henry), revealed a profound symmetry in the laws of electromagnetism: just as electric currents produce magnetic fields, changing magnetic fields produce electric currents. This principle is the cornerstone of modern electrical technology, from power generation and transmission to countless electronic devices.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Before Faraday, the primary interaction known was that electricity could produce magnetism (Oersted's discovery). Faraday's work completed the picture, demonstrating that magnetism could also produce electricity. This deep connection eventually led James Clerk Maxwell to unify electricity and magnetism into a single, elegant theory of electromagnetism, described by Maxwell's Equations. In this lesson, we will explore Faraday's Law, Lenz's Law, motional EMF, and the concepts of mutual and self-inductance, along with their vital applications.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Before discussing Faraday's Law, we need to understand <span class="glossary-term">magnetic flux ($\Phi_B$)</span>. Magnetic flux is a measure of the total number of magnetic field lines passing through a given area. It quantifies the "amount" of magnetic field penetrating a surface.
                </p>
                <div class="equation">

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    For a uniform magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) passing perpendicularly through a flat surface of area ($A$), the magnetic flux simplifies to:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\Phi_B = BA\cos\theta$$

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity. It is maximum when the magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the surface ($\theta = 0^\circ$, $\cos\theta = 1$) and zero when they are parallel to the surface ($\theta = 90^\circ$, $\cos\theta = 0$).

                    <span class="glossary-term">Faraday's Law of Induction</span> is the quantitative law that describes how a changing magnetic flux through a circuit induces an electromotive force (EMF), and consequently, an electric current if the circuit is closed.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The law states that the magnitude of the induced EMF ($\mathcal{E}$) in a circuit is directly proportional to the rate at which the magnetic flux ($\Phi_B$) through the circuit changes. If the circuit consists of $N$ loops of wire, the induced EMF is:

                    A current will flow in the circuit if there is a complete path. The magnitude of the induced current $I$ would be $I = \mathcal{E}/R$, where $R$ is the resistance of the circuit.

                    In simpler terms, nature resists changes in magnetic flux. If the magnetic flux through a loop is increasing, the induced current will create a magnetic field pointing in the opposite direction to try and counteract that increase. If the magnetic flux is decreasing, the induced current will create a magnetic field pointing in the same direction as the original field to try and reinforce it.

                    <span class="glossary-term">Motional EMF</span> is the electromotive force (voltage) induced across a conductor that moves through a magnetic field. It is a direct consequence of the Lorentz force acting on the free charges within the conductor.

                <h3 class="subsection-title">4.1 Derivation of Motional EMF</h3>

                    Consider a straight conductor of length $L$ moving with a constant velocity $\vec{v}$ perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$. The free charges (electrons) within the conductor also move with this velocity.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Each charge $q$ within the conductor experiences a magnetic force due to its motion in the field: $\vec{F}_B = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The direction of this force on positive charges (or opposite for electrons) will be along the length of the conductor, pushing them to one end. This separation of charges creates an electric field within the conductor, and thus a potential difference across its ends. The charges continue to accumulate until the electric force from the accumulated charges balances the magnetic force.
