                    <span class="glossary-term">Circular motion</span> is a type of motion where an object travels along a circular path or a circular arc. From the spinning blades of a helicopter to the orbits of planets around the sun, and the thrilling loops of a roller coaster, circular motion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the physical world. Understanding its principles is fundamental to many areas of physics and engineering.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    While seemingly simple, motion in a circle is fundamentally different from linear motion because the direction of the object's velocity is constantly changing, even if its speed remains constant. This change in direction implies that there must be an acceleration, and consequently, a force acting on the object. This lesson will explore the kinematics (description) and dynamics (causes) of circular motion, distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform cases, and delving into various real-world applications.

                    <span class="glossary-term">Uniform Circular Motion (UCM)</span> describes the motion of an object moving in a circular path at a constant speed. Despite the constant speed, the object's velocity is continuously changing because its direction is constantly changing. This change in velocity means there is an acceleration, and by Newton's Second Law, a net force.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">2.1 Centripetal Acceleration ($\vec{a}_c$)</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The acceleration in uniform circular motion is called <span class="glossary-term">centripetal acceleration ($\vec{a}_c$)</span>, meaning "center-seeking." It is always directed towards the center of the circular path, perpendicular to the tangential velocity.

                    According to Newton's Second Law ($\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$), if there's an acceleration, there must be a net force causing it.

                    It is crucial to understand that centripetal force is *not* a new type of force. Rather, it is the *net* force acting towards the center, provided by other fundamental forces like tension, gravity, friction, or normal force. For example:

                    <li>A satellite orbiting Earth: Gravitational force provides the centripetal force.</li>

                    <p>We know that $f_s \le \mu_s F_N$. On a flat road, $F_N = mg = (1200\, \text{kg})(9.8\, \text{m/s}^2) = 11760\, \text{N}$.</p>
                    <p>For the minimum friction, $f_s = F_c$, so $6000\, \text{N} = \mu_s (11760\, \text{N})$.</p>
