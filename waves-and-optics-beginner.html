            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Welcome to a fascinating exploration of <span class="key-term">Waves and Optics</span>, two interconnected branches of physics that profoundly shape our perception of the world. From the ripples in a pond to the intricate workings of a telescope, from the sound of music to the vibrant colors we perceive, wave phenomena are ubiquitous. At the heart of optics lies light, a form of electromagnetic wave, whose behavior dictates how we see, how cameras capture images, and how information travels across vast distances.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In this extensive lesson, we will embark on a journey to understand the fundamental nature of waves. We will define their key characteristics – <span class="key-term">amplitude</span>, <span class="key-term">wavelength ($\lambda$)</span>, <span class="key-term">frequency ($f$)</span>, and <span class="key-term">period ($T$)</span> – and discover the crucial relationship that binds them to <span class="key-term">wave speed ($v$)</span>. We'll differentiate between various types of waves, such as transverse and longitudinal, setting the stage for understanding light itself.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Our focus will then shift to <span class="key-term">optics</span>, the study of light. We will explore its basic properties and then delve into two of its most fundamental interactions with matter: <span class="key-term">reflection</span> and <span class="key-term">refraction</span>. We'll learn the laws governing these phenomena, including the pivotal <span class="key-term">Law of Reflection</span> for mirrors and <span class="key-term">Snell's Law</span> for lenses and other transparent media. Practical applications, from the everyday use of mirrors to the complex designs of optical instruments, will illustrate the profound impact of these principles.

            <h3 class="text-4xl mb-6">2. Fundamental Characteristics of Waves</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                A <span class="key-term">wave</span> is a disturbance that propagates through space and time, usually by the transfer of energy without the net transfer of matter. Think of a ripple in a pond: the water oscillates up and down, but the disturbance (the wave) travels outwards.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">2.1. Types of Waves</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Waves can be broadly classified based on the direction of oscillation of the medium's particles relative to the direction of wave propagation:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="key-term">Transverse Waves:</span> The particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Examples include waves on a string, electromagnetic waves (like light), and ocean waves.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="key-term">Longitudinal Waves:</span> The particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation. These waves consist of compressions (regions of high density/pressure) and rarefactions (regions of low density/pressure). Sound waves are the most common example of longitudinal waves.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Another classification is based on whether a medium is required:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="key-term">Mechanical Waves:</span> Require a medium to travel through (e.g., sound waves, water waves, waves on a spring).
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="key-term">Electromagnetic Waves:</span> Do not require a medium and can travel through a vacuum (e.g., light, radio waves, X-rays). These are self-propagating oscillations of electric and magnetic fields.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">2.2. Key Wave Properties</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                To describe waves quantitatively, we use several key properties:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="key-term">Amplitude ($A$):</span> The maximum displacement or distance moved by a point on a vibrating body or wave measured from its equilibrium position. For a water wave, it's the height from the equilibrium level to a crest or trough. For a sound wave, it's related to the pressure variation. Amplitude is related to the energy carried by the wave.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="key-term">Wavelength ($\lambda$):</span> The spatial period of the wave, the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It is the distance between two consecutive corresponding points on a wave, such as two adjacent crests or two adjacent troughs. Measured in meters (m).
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="key-term">Frequency ($f$):</span> The number of complete oscillations or cycles that pass a given point per unit of time. Measured in Hertz (Hz), where $1 \text{ Hz} = 1 \text{ cycle/second}$. Frequency is determined by the source of the wave.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="key-term">Period ($T$):</span> The time it takes for one complete oscillation or cycle to pass a given point. It is the reciprocal of frequency. Measured in seconds (s).
                    <div class="math-equation">
                        $$T = \frac{1}{f}$$
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="key-term">Wave Speed ($v$):</span> The speed at which the wave propagates through the medium. It's the distance a wave travels per unit of time.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">2.3. The Wave Speed Equation</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The wave speed, wavelength, and frequency are intimately related by a fundamental equation:
            </p>
            <div class="math-equation">
                $$v = f\lambda$$
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
                    <li>$v$ is the <span class="key-term">wave speed</span> (in m/s).</li>
                    <li>$f$ is the <span class="key-term">frequency</span> (in Hz).</li>
                    <li>$\lambda$ is the <span class="key-term">wavelength</span> (in m).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This equation tells us that if a wave has a high frequency, it must have a short wavelength to maintain a certain speed, and vice-versa. The speed of a wave is determined by the properties of the medium through which it travels, not by its source's frequency or amplitude.
            </p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Example: Wave Speed Calculation</h4>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    A sound wave in air has a frequency of $440 \text{ Hz}$ (Concert A) and a wavelength of $0.78 \text{ m}$. What is the speed of sound in air?
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <span class="font-bold">Given:</span> $f = 440 \text{ Hz}$, $\lambda = 0.78 \text{ m}$.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Using $v = f\lambda$:
                    $$v = (440 \text{ Hz})(0.78 \text{ m})$$
                    $$v = 343.2 \text{ m/s}$$
                    The speed of sound in air is approximately $343 \text{ m/s}$.

        <section id="light-properties" class="section-card">
            <h3 class="text-4xl mb-6">3. Basic Properties of Light</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <span class="key-term">Light</span> is a specific type of <span class="key-term">electromagnetic wave</span>, which is a transverse wave consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of energy transfer. Unlike mechanical waves, light does not require a medium and can travel through the vacuum of space.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">3.1. The Electromagnetic Spectrum</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Visible light is just a small portion of the vast <span class="key-term">electromagnetic spectrum</span>, which includes (in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength): radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">3.2. Speed of Light in Vacuum ($c$)</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental physical constant, denoted by $c$. Its value is approximately:
            </p>
            <div class="math-equation">
                $$c = 299,792,458 \text{ m/s} \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$$
            </div>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This incredibly high speed is why light seems to travel instantaneously over short distances. In transparent media (like water or glass), light travels slower than $c$.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">3.3. Wave-Particle Duality (Brief Mention)</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                One of the most intriguing aspects of light is its <span class="key-term">wave-particle duality</span>. While light undeniably exhibits wave-like properties (like interference and diffraction, which we'll briefly mention), it also behaves like a particle, called a <span class="key-term">photon</span>, in certain interactions (like the photoelectric effect). For most introductory optics, treating light as a wave is sufficient.

            <h3 class="text-4xl mb-6">5. Refraction: Bending Through Media</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <span class="key-term">Refraction</span> is the bending of a wave as it passes from one medium into another, due to a change in the wave's speed. When light passes from air into water, for example, its speed changes, causing it to bend. This phenomenon is responsible for why objects submerged in water appear distorted, and how lenses work.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">5.1. Index of Refraction ($n$)</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The <span class="key-term">index of refraction ($n$)</span> of a medium is a dimensionless quantity that describes how much light slows down when it enters that medium. It is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum ($c$) to the speed of light in the medium ($v$):
            </p>
            <div class="math-equation">
                $$n = \frac{c}{v}$$
            </div>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The index of refraction is always greater than or equal to 1. For a vacuum, $n=1$. For air, $n \approx 1.0003$. For water, $n \approx 1.33$. For glass, $n$ typically ranges from $1.5$ to $1.9$. A higher index of refraction means light travels slower in that medium and bends more when entering or leaving it.

                    A light ray passes from air ($n_1 = 1.00$) into water ($n_2 = 1.33$) at an angle of incidence of $30^\circ$. What is the angle of refraction?
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    Using Snell's Law: $n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)$
                    $$1.00 \sin(30^\circ) = 1.33 \sin(\theta_2)$$
                    $$1.00 \times 0.5 = 1.33 \sin(\theta_2)$$
                    $$0.5 = 1.33 \sin(\theta_2)$$
                    $$\sin(\theta_2) = \frac{0.5}{1.33} \approx 0.376$$
                    $$\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.376) \approx 22.1^\circ$$
                    The angle of refraction is approximately $22.1^\circ$. The light bends towards the normal, as expected when entering a denser medium.

                When light travels from a denser medium to a less dense medium (e.g., from water to air), there is a critical angle.

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">6.1. Interference</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <span class="key-term">Interference</span> occurs when two or more waves overlap, resulting in a new wave pattern whose amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves.

                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="font-bold">Constructive Interference:</span> Occurs when waves combine "in phase" (crest meets crest, trough meets trough), resulting in a larger amplitude.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <span class="font-bold">Destructive Interference:</span> Occurs when waves combine "out of phase" (crest meets trough), resulting in a smaller or even zero amplitude.

            <h4 class="text-3xl mb-4">6.2. Diffraction</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <span class="key-term">Diffraction</span> is the bending of waves around obstacles or the spreading out of waves as they pass through narrow openings. This phenomenon is why you can hear sound around a corner even if you can't see the source, and why light passing through a tiny slit produces a spreading pattern instead of a sharp image.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The amount of diffraction is most significant when the wavelength of the wave is comparable to the size of the obstacle or opening. This is why sound waves (long wavelengths) diffract easily around everyday objects, while visible light waves (short wavelengths) do not, unless the opening is very small.
