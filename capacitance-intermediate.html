                    In the realm of electricity, just as mechanical systems can store potential energy, electrical systems can store <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">electrical energy</span> in devices called <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">capacitors</span>. A capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. The fundamental property of a capacitor is its <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">capacitance (C)</span>, which is a measure of its ability to store an electric charge. Capacitance is defined as the ratio of the amount of electric charge ($Q$) stored on a conductor to the potential difference ($V$) across it:

                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                    The SI unit of capacitance is the <span class="font-medium text-white">Farad (F)</span>, named after Michael Faraday. One Farad is equal to one Coulomb per Volt ($1 \text{ F} = 1 \text{ C/V}$). Due to the Farad being a very large unit, capacitance is often expressed in microfarads ($\mu$F, $10^{-6}$ F), nanofarads (nF, $10^{-9}$ F), or picofarads (pF, $10^{-12}$ F). A common type of capacitor is the <span class="font-medium text-white">parallel-plate capacitor</span>, which consists of two parallel conducting plates separated by a small distance. For such a capacitor, the capacitance is directly proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between them.

                    Just like resistors, capacitors can be connected in series or parallel to form equivalent capacitance values.

The total charge stored is the sum of the charges on each capacitor. This configuration effectively increases the total plate area, leading to an increase in overall capacitance. The <span class="font-bold text-blue-accent">equivalent capacitance ($C_{eq}$)</span> for capacitors in parallel is the sum of individual capacitances:

                        <span class="font-medium text-white">Capacitors in Series:</span> When capacitors are connected in series, they are connected end-to-end. In this configuration, the charge on each capacitor is the same, but the total potential difference is divided among them. This arrangement is analogous to increasing the effective distance between the plates, which reduces the overall capacitance. The reciprocal of the <span class="font-bold text-blue-accent">equivalent capacitance ($C_{eq}$)</span> for capacitors in series is the sum of the reciprocals of individual capacitances:
                        <div class="overflow-x-auto-md-down p-4 bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-inner text-center mt-2 mb-2">

                        </div>
                        For two capacitors in series, this simplifies to $C_{eq} = \frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1 + C_2}$.

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                    To increase the capacitance of a capacitor and improve its performance, a non-conducting material, known as a <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">dielectric material</span>, is often inserted between the conducting plates. Common dielectric materials include paper, mica, ceramic, or plastic.

                        <span class="font-medium text-white">Electric Field Reduction:</span> When an electric field is applied across a dielectric, the molecules within it become polarized (their positive and negative charges slightly separate). This internal polarization creates an induced electric field within the dielectric that opposes the applied electric field. The net electric field between the plates is thus reduced. Since $V = Ed$ (for a uniform field), a reduced $E$ means a reduced $V$ for the same charge $Q$.
                    </li>

                        <span class="font-medium text-white">Increased Charge Storage:</span> Because the potential difference $V$ is reduced for a given charge $Q$, more charge can be stored for the same potential difference, effectively increasing the capacitance ($C = Q/V$).

                        <span class="font-medium text-white">Dielectric Strength:</span> Dielectrics also increase the voltage at which the capacitor breaks down (its <span class="font-medium text-white">dielectric strength</span>), allowing for higher operating voltages.

                    The effect of a dielectric on capacitance is quantified by its <span class="font-medium text-white">dielectric constant ($\kappa$)</span> (kappa), also known as relative permittivity.

                    An <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">RC circuit</span> is a circuit containing both a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C). These circuits are fundamental in electronics for filtering, timing, and smoothing applications. When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source through a resistor, it does not charge instantaneously. Instead, it charges gradually, and the rate of charging (or discharging) is determined by the <span class="text-blue-accent font-medium">time constant ($\tau$)</span> of the circuit.

                    The time constant ($\tau$) of an RC circuit is the product of the resistance ($R$) and the capacitance ($C$):

                    The unit of the time constant is seconds (s) when $R$ is in Ohms ($\Omega$) and $C$ is in Farads (F).

                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    The time constant represents the time required for the capacitor to charge to approximately 63.2% of its maximum voltage (when charging) or to discharge to approximately 36.8% (1 - 0.632) of its initial voltage (when discharging). After five time constants ($5\tau$), the capacitor is considered almost fully charged or discharged. RC circuits are essential for understanding transient behavior in electrical circuits and for designing systems that require specific delays or response times.
