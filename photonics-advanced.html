                    While electronics deals with the control and application of electrons, <span class="font-semibold text-blue-300">photonics</span> is the science and technology of generating, manipulating, and detecting photonsâ€”the fundamental particles of light. It encompasses everything from the humble light bulb to the sophisticated lasers that drive fiber optic communications, perform delicate surgeries, and power advanced manufacturing processes. Photonics is an interdisciplinary field, drawing upon optics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, materials science, and electrical engineering, to harness the unique properties of light for a vast array of applications.

                <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    The 20th century was largely the "century of electronics," but the 21st century is rapidly becoming the "century of photonics." The invention of the laser in 1960 marked a pivotal moment, providing a controllable, coherent source of light that revolutionized countless fields. Since then, advancements in optical fibers, waveguides, detectors, and light-matter interaction have propelled photonics into the forefront of technological innovation. It is the backbone of the internet, enabling high-speed data transmission across continents, and is vital for medical diagnostics, industrial manufacturing, defense, and scientific research.

                    At its core, photonics explores the quantum nature of light and its interaction with matter. Unlike electronics, which often deals with dissipative energy loss due to electron resistance, photons can travel great distances with minimal energy loss, making them ideal carriers of information. This lesson will delve into advanced topics in photonics, exploring the intricacies of laser physics, the marvel of optical fibers, the design of waveguides, and the fascinating world where light interacts with matter at a quantum level, including the intriguing phenomena of non-linear optics. Prepare to illuminate your understanding of this radiant field!

                    <span class="font-semibold text-blue-300">Optical fibers</span> are thin strands of highly pure glass (silica) or plastic, designed to transmit light over long distances with minimal loss.

                    3.1. Principle of Total Internal Reflection
                </h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    An optical fiber consists of three main parts:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                    <li><span class="font-semibold text-blue-300">Core:</span> The inner part of the fiber, typically made of silica, through which light travels. It has a higher refractive index ($n_1$).</li>
                    <li><span class="font-semibold text-blue-300">Cladding:</span> A layer surrounding the core, also made of silica or plastic, but with a slightly lower refractive index ($n_2 < n_1$).</li>
                    <li><span class="font-semibold text-blue-300">Coating (Buffer):</span> A protective outer layer that shields the fiber from damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    When light enters the core at a shallow angle, it strikes the interface between the core and cladding. Because $n_1 > n_2$, if the angle of incidence exceeds a critical angle ($\theta_c$), the light undergoes total internal reflection and is reflected back into the core, continuing to propagate down the fiber.

                <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    In most everyday situations, light propagates through materials linearly; meaning, the properties of light (like its frequency) don't change, and two light beams passing through each other don't interact. However, when light intensity becomes very high (e.g., from powerful lasers), the response of a material to the light field is no longer linear. This phenomenon is studied in <span class="font-semibold text-blue-300">non-linear optics</span>, where light can effectively interact with itself or generate new frequencies.

                <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    The linear response of a material is described by its refractive index ($n$) and absorption coefficient. In non-linear optics, the polarization of the material (its electrical response to the light field $E$) depends on higher powers of the electric field:
