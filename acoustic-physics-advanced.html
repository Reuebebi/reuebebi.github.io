                <p>
                    <strong>Acoustic Physics</strong> is the branch of physics dedicated to the study of sound and vibrations. It encompasses the generation, transmission, reception, and control of mechanical waves in various mediaâ€”gases, liquids, and solids. From the subtle rustle of leaves to the complex harmonies of a symphony orchestra, from the diagnostic power of medical ultrasound to the roar of a jet engine, sound is an omnipresent phenomenon that profoundly impacts our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This field is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing upon principles from mechanics, fluid dynamics, wave theory, and even neuroscience (in the study of human sound perception). Medical physics, environmental science, engineering, music, and architecture all rely heavily on a deep understanding of acoustics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This comprehensive lesson on <strong>Acoustic Physics</strong> will guide you through the fundamental nature of sound waves, their behavior in different environments, how humans perceive them, and the practical applications of acoustic principles in designing spaces, controlling noise, and developing advanced technologies. Prepare to tune into the intricate world of sound and vibration!

                <h2 class="text-4xl">2. Fundamentals of Sound Waves</h2>
                <p>
                    Sound is a mechanical wave, meaning it requires a medium to propagate. It is the result of vibrations that create pressure oscillations which travel through a substance.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">2.1. Wave Properties</h3>
                <p>
                    Sound waves are typically longitudinal waves, where the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frequency ($f$):</strong> The number of complete oscillations (cycles) per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). It primarily determines the perceived pitch of a sound.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Audible range for humans: Approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz).</li>
                            <li>Infrasound: Below 20 Hz.</li>
                            <li>Ultrasound: Above 20 kHz.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wavelength ($\lambda$):</strong> The spatial period of the wave, the distance over which the wave's shape repeats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amplitude:</strong> The maximum displacement or pressure variation from the equilibrium position. It determines the perceived loudness of a sound.</li>
                    <li><strong>Period ($T$):</strong> The time taken for one complete oscillation ($T = 1/f$).</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="equation">
                    $v = f\lambda$
                </div>
                <p>
                    where $v$ is the speed of the wave.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">2.2. Speed of Sound</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>speed of sound ($v$)</strong> depends on the properties of the medium through which it travels. Generally, sound travels faster in denser and stiffer (less compressible) media.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a fluid (liquid or gas):
                        <div class="equation">
                            $v = \sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}$
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            where $K$ is the bulk modulus (a measure of compressibility) and $\rho$ is the density of the medium.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>In a solid rod:
                        <div class="equation">
                            $v = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}$
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            where $E$ is Young's modulus (a measure of stiffness for solids) and $\rho$ is the density.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Examples of approximate speed of sound at $20^\circ\text{C}$:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Air: $\approx 343 \text{ m/s}$</li>
                    <li>Water: $\approx 1482 \text{ m/s}$</li>
                    <li>Steel: $\approx 5100 \text{ m/s}$</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Temperature significantly affects the speed of sound, particularly in gases (e.g., in air, $v \propto \sqrt{T}$).
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">2.3. Intensity and Loudness</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sound Intensity ($I$)</strong> is the power carried by the sound wave per unit area perpendicular to the direction of propagation, measured in Watts per square meter ($W/m^2$).
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $I = \frac{P}{A}$
                </div>
                <p>
                    where $P$ is sound power and $A$ is area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the human ear perceives sound intensity logarithmically, the <strong>sound intensity level ($\beta$)</strong> is measured in decibels (dB):
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $\beta = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)$
                </div>
                <p>
                    where $I_0$ is the reference intensity (threshold of human hearing, $10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Loudness</strong> is the subjective perception of sound intensity by the human ear, which is also influenced by frequency (see Psychoacoustics).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sound pressure is another common measure, and sound pressure level (SPL) is related to intensity level, also measured in dB.

            <section id="wave-propagation" class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-4xl">3. Wave Propagation in Different Media</h2>
                <p>
                    As sound waves travel through various media, they interact with the material's properties, leading to phenomena like transmission, reflection, absorption, and diffraction.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">3.1. Transmission, Reflection, and Refraction</h3>
                <p>
                    When a sound wave encounters an interface between two different media:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> Part of the sound energy passes into the second medium. The amount transmitted depends on the acoustic impedance mismatch between the two media.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Part of the sound energy bounces back into the first medium. Greater impedance mismatch leads to more reflection. Echoes are a result of sound reflection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refraction:</strong> The bending of sound waves as they pass from one medium to another where their speed changes. This is governed by Snell's Law (similar to light waves). Sound also refracts due to temperature gradients in a single medium (e.g., sound bending upwards on a hot day).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The <strong>acoustic impedance ($Z$)</strong> of a medium is a critical parameter, defined as $Z = \rho v$, where $\rho$ is density and $v$ is the speed of sound. The reflection coefficient ($R$) at a boundary is given by:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $R = \left(\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\right)^2$
                </div>
                <p>
                    where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the acoustic impedances of the first and second media, respectively.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">3.2. Absorption and Attenuation</h3>
                <p>
                    As sound propagates, its intensity decreases, a phenomenon known as <strong>attenuation</strong>. This is due to two main mechanisms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> The conversion of sound energy into other forms of energy, primarily heat, within the medium. This occurs due to viscous effects, thermal conduction, and molecular relaxation. More porous or fibrous materials are generally good sound absorbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spreading (Geometric Attenuation):</strong> As sound radiates from a source, its energy spreads out over an increasingly larger area, leading to a decrease in intensity proportional to $1/r^2$ for spherical waves (where $r$ is distance from source).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The attenuation coefficient ($\alpha$) describes the rate at which sound intensity decreases with distance in a medium.
                </p>

                <h3 class="3xl">3.3. Diffraction and Scattering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diffraction:</strong> The bending of sound waves around obstacles or the spreading of waves after passing through an aperture. The extent of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the sound relative to the size of the obstacle or opening. Lower frequencies (longer wavelengths) diffract more easily. This is why you can hear sound around a corner even if you can't see the source.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scattering:</strong> Occurs when sound waves encounter irregularities or inhomogeneities in the medium or surface, causing the sound energy to be redirected in multiple directions. Rough surfaces scatter sound, while smooth surfaces reflect it specularly. Scattering is important in architectural acoustics for creating diffuse sound fields.</li>

                <h2 class="text-4xl">4. Acoustic Phenomena</h2>
                <p>
                    Various phenomena arise from the wave nature of sound, influencing everything from musical instruments to noise cancellation.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">4.1. Resonance and Standing Waves</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Resonance</strong> occurs when a system is driven at its natural frequency (or one of its natural frequencies), leading to a large amplitude of vibration. All objects have natural frequencies at which they prefer to vibrate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Standing waves</strong> (or stationary waves) are formed when two waves of the same frequency and amplitude traveling in opposite directions interfere. They appear to stand still, with fixed points of no displacement (nodes) and maximum displacement (antinodes).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In instruments like organ pipes or strings, standing waves are formed at specific resonant frequencies, determined by the length of the instrument and the speed of sound in the medium. These resonant frequencies produce the musical notes.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">4.2. Doppler Effect</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Doppler effect</strong> is the change in frequency (and thus pitch) of a wave observed when the source of the wave, the observer, or both are in motion relative to the medium.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the source and observer are moving closer, the perceived frequency increases (higher pitch).</li>
                    <li>If they are moving farther apart, the perceived frequency decreases (lower pitch).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The observed frequency ($f'$) for a moving source and/or observer is given by:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $f' = f \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s}$
                </div>
                <p>
                    where $f$ is the emitted frequency, $v$ is the speed of sound in the medium, $v_o$ is the speed of the observer, and $v_s$ is the speed of the source. The signs depend on the direction of motion (approaching or receding).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Doppler effect is widely used in medical ultrasound to measure blood flow (as discussed in the Medical Physics lesson), in radar, and in astronomy.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">4.3. Superposition and Interference</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Principle of Superposition</strong> states that when two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement at any point and at any instant is the vector sum of the displacements of the individual waves at that point and instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This leads to <strong>interference</strong> phenomena:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Constructive Interference:</strong> When waves combine in phase, their amplitudes add up, resulting in a louder sound.</li>
                    <li><strong>Destructive Interference:</strong> When waves combine out of phase, their amplitudes subtract, resulting in a quieter sound or silence. This is the principle behind active noise cancellation technology.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Interference patterns are common in rooms, leading to "hot spots" and "dead spots" for certain frequencies.

                <h2 class="text-4xl">5. Psychoacoustics: The Perception of Sound</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Psychoacoustics</strong> is an interdisciplinary field that studies the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound, bridging acoustic physics with sensory perception, cognitive science, and audiology. It investigates how humans (and animals) perceive sound and why certain acoustic properties lead to specific auditory experiences.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">5.1. Loudness Perception</h3>
                <p>
                    While sound intensity is a physical measure, <strong>loudness</strong> is a subjective perceptual attribute.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frequency Dependence:</strong> The human ear is most sensitive to frequencies between 2 kHz and 5 kHz. Sounds at very low or very high frequencies require significantly higher intensities to be perceived as equally loud. This is described by <strong>Fletcher-Munson curves</strong> (or equal-loudness contours).</li>
                    <li><strong>Masking:</strong> The phenomenon where the perception of one sound is affected by the presence of another sound. A loud sound can "mask" a quieter sound, especially if they are close in frequency. This is exploited in audio compression algorithms (e.g., MP3).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Loudness is measured in units of <strong>phons</strong> (which relates intensity level to equal perceived loudness at 1 kHz) and <strong>sone</strong> (a linear scale of perceived loudness).
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">5.2. Pitch Perception</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pitch</strong> is the subjective perceptual attribute that allows sounds to be ordered on a frequency-related scale. It is primarily determined by the fundamental frequency of the sound wave.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Harmonics and Timbre:</strong> Most sounds are not pure tones but consist of a fundamental frequency and integer multiples called harmonics (overtones). The relative amplitudes of these harmonics determine the sound's <strong>timbre</strong> (or tone quality), allowing us to distinguish between different musical instruments playing the same note.</li>
                    <li><strong>Missing Fundamental:</strong> The ear/brain can perceive the pitch of a fundamental frequency even if it is not physically present, as long as its harmonics are.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">5.3. Timbre and Spatial Hearing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Timbre:</strong> As mentioned, this is what gives a sound its unique "color" or "quality," enabling us to differentiate between the same musical note played on a piano versus a violin. It's determined by the harmonic content, attack and decay envelopes, and vibrato.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spatial Hearing (Sound Localization):</strong> The ability to determine the direction and distance of a sound source. This relies on several cues:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Interaural Time Difference (ITD):</strong> The difference in arrival time of a sound between the two ears (effective for low frequencies).</li>
                            <li><strong>Interaural Level Difference (ILD):</strong> The difference in sound intensity between the two ears due to the "head shadow" effect (effective for high frequencies).</li>
                            <li><strong>Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF):</strong> The way the pinna (outer ear), head, and torso modify the sound before it reaches the eardrums, providing spectral cues for elevation and front-back localization.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Understanding psychoacoustics is crucial for designing effective audio systems, creating immersive virtual reality experiences, and developing hearing aids.

            <section id="architectural-acoustics" class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-4xl">6. Architectural Acoustics</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Architectural Acoustics</strong> is the science of designing spaces to optimize sound quality, whether for speech intelligibility in lecture halls, musical performance in concert halls, or privacy in offices. It involves controlling how sound behaves within an enclosed environment.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">6.1. Reverberation and Reverberation Time</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reverberation</strong> is the persistence of sound in an enclosed space after the original sound source has stopped, caused by multiple reflections of sound waves from walls, ceiling, and floor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reverberation Time ($T_{60}$)</strong> is the primary metric in architectural acoustics. It is defined as the time it takes for the sound intensity level to decay by 60 dB after the sound source has stopped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Sabine Formula</strong> provides a basic estimate for reverberation time:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $T_{60} = \frac{0.161 V}{A}$
                </div>
                <p>
                    where $V$ is the volume of the room in cubic meters ($m^3$), and $A$ is the total sound absorption in Sabine units ($m^2$ Sabine). The total absorption $A$ is calculated as the sum of the surface areas ($S_i$) multiplied by their respective sound absorption coefficients ($\alpha_i$): $A = \sum S_i \alpha_i$.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Too long $T_{60}$: Sound becomes muddy, speech unintelligible.</li>
                    <li>Too short $T_{60}$: Room sounds "dead," music lacks warmth.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Optimal reverberation times vary significantly depending on the room's purpose (e.g., concert halls require longer $T_{60}$ than classrooms).
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">6.2. Sound Absorption and Diffusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Architectural acousticians use various materials and geometries to control sound reflections:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sound Absorption:</strong> Materials designed to absorb sound energy, reducing reverberation. Porous materials (fiberglass, foam, fabric) and resonant absorbers (perforated panels, Helmholtz resonators) are common. The <strong>sound absorption coefficient ($\alpha$)</strong> ranges from 0 (perfect reflection) to 1 (perfect absorption).</li>
                    <li><strong>Sound Diffusion:</strong> Surfaces designed to scatter sound reflections evenly in multiple directions, creating a more uniform sound field and preventing echoes. Diffusers often have complex, irregular shapes (e.g., Quadratic Residue Diffusers).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">6.3. Room Modes (Standing Waves in Rooms)</h3>
                <p>
                    In enclosed spaces, sound waves can reflect between parallel surfaces, creating <strong>room modes</strong> or standing waves at specific frequencies. These modes can cause uneven sound distribution, with certain frequencies being unnaturally loud (at antinodes) or quiet (at nodes) at different locations in the room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three types of room modes exist: axial (between two parallel surfaces), tangential (between four surfaces), and oblique (between six surfaces). Managing room modes is critical in small listening rooms, recording studios, and control rooms to ensure a flat and accurate frequency response. Strategies include splayed walls, bass traps, and diffusers.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">6.4. Sound Isolation and Noise Transmission</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sound isolation</strong> (or soundproofing) aims to prevent sound from entering or leaving a space. This involves addressing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Airborne Sound Transmission:</strong> Sound traveling through the air. Reduced by using heavy, dense materials (mass law) and by creating multiple layers with air gaps (mass-spring-mass system). The <strong>Sound Transmission Class (STC)</strong> rating quantifies a partition's ability to reduce airborne sound.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structure-Borne Sound (Vibration) Transmission:</strong> Sound traveling through the building structure. Reduced by isolating vibrating equipment or by using resilient mounts. The <strong>Impact Isolation Class (IIC)</strong> rating quantifies a floor's ability to reduce impact noise.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Proper sound isolation is essential for privacy, noise control, and preventing disturbance between different functional areas in a building.

            <section id="noise-control" class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-4xl">7. Noise Control and Abatement</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Noise control</strong> is a crucial aspect of applied acoustics, focusing on reducing unwanted sound (noise) to improve environmental quality, health, and comfort. It involves identifying noise sources, measuring noise levels, and implementing strategies to mitigate its impact.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">7.1. Noise Sources and Measurement</h3>
                <p>
                    Noise can originate from various sources: industrial machinery, transportation (vehicles, aircraft), construction, human activities, and natural phenomena.
                </p>
                <h4>7.1.1. Noise Measurement</h4>
                <p>
                    Noise levels are typically measured using <strong>sound level meters</strong>, which capture sound pressure levels and often apply frequency-weighting filters (e.g., A-weighting, C-weighting) to approximate human hearing sensitivity.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A-weighted decibels (dBA):</strong> Most commonly used for environmental and occupational noise, as it de-emphasizes low frequencies to match how the human ear perceives loudness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equivalent Continuous Sound Level ($L_{eq}$):</strong> The average noise level over a specified period, accounting for fluctuating noise sources.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Noise limits are set by regulations to protect hearing and prevent nuisance.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">7.2. Noise Reduction Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    Noise control strategies often follow a hierarchy:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Control at Source:</strong> The most effective approach. This includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Design Changes:</strong> Designing quieter machinery, using low-noise components.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Regular maintenance to reduce wear and tear that can cause noise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vibration Isolation:</strong> Using resilient mounts, springs, or damping materials to prevent vibrations from being transmitted from equipment to structures (see next section).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Control Along Path:</strong> Interrupting the noise transmission path:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Enclosures and Barriers:</strong> Building sound-tight enclosures around noisy equipment or erecting sound barriers (e.g., along highways) to block sound propagation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> Adding sound-absorbing materials to rooms to reduce reverberation and overall noise levels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Increasing the distance between the source and receiver (as sound intensity decreases with distance).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Control at Receiver:</strong> Protecting the person exposed to noise:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):</strong> Earplugs, earmuffs for workers in noisy environments.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quiet Areas/Refuges:</strong> Designing spaces where noise levels are acceptable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):</strong> Using destructive interference to cancel out unwanted noise (e.g., in headphones, car cabins). A microphone detects the noise, and a speaker generates an "anti-noise" sound wave that is 180 degrees out of phase, canceling the original noise.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">7.3. Vibration Isolation</h3>
                <p>
                    Vibrations are mechanical oscillations that can cause structural fatigue, discomfort, and generate noise. <strong>Vibration isolation</strong> involves preventing the transmission of unwanted vibrations from a source to a receiver.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mounts and Dampers:</strong> Using resilient materials (rubber, springs, air cushions) or specialized damping devices to absorb or dissipate vibrational energy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resonance Control:</strong> Designing systems so that their natural frequencies do not match potential excitation frequencies, preventing resonant amplification of vibrations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mass-Spring Systems:</strong> Heavy foundations or inertia blocks can be used with springs to isolate vibrating machinery.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Vibration control is critical in buildings (to prevent noise transmission, protect sensitive equipment), in automotive design, and in sensitive scientific instruments.

                <h2 class="text-4xl">8. Underwater Acoustics</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Underwater Acoustics</strong> is the study of the propagation of sound in water, focusing on oceans, lakes, and rivers. Sound behaves very differently in water compared to air due to the vastly different physical properties of the medium (density, compressibility). It is a vital field for oceanography, marine biology, defense, and offshore industries.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">8.1. Sound Propagation in Water</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speed of Sound:</strong> Much faster in water ($\approx 1500 \text{ m/s}$) than in air. It varies with temperature, salinity, and pressure (depth). This variation creates "sound channels" (like the SOFAR channel) where sound can travel thousands of kilometers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attenuation:</strong> Sound attenuates less rapidly in water than in air, allowing it to travel much longer distances. Absorption increases with frequency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reflection and Refraction:</strong> Sound reflects strongly off the seafloor, surface, and objects in the water. Refraction occurs due to changes in the speed of sound, bending sound rays and creating shadow zones or convergence zones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scattering:</strong> Sound scatters off marine life (fish, plankton), bubbles, and seafloor irregularities. This scattering is used in biological surveys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ambient Noise:</strong> Underwater noise comes from natural sources (waves, marine animals, seismic activity) and anthropogenic sources (shipping, sonar, offshore construction).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl">8.2. Sonar Systems (Sound Navigation And Ranging)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sonar</strong> uses sound waves to detect objects and measure distances underwater, analogous to radar for air.
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Active Sonar:</strong> Emits sound pulses (pings) and listens for echoes. The time delay of the echo indicates distance, and the direction of the echo indicates bearing. Used for submarine detection, mapping the seafloor (bathymetry), and fish finding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Passive Sonar:</strong> Listens for sounds emitted by objects (e.g., ships, marine animals) without emitting its own signal. Used for stealthy detection and identification.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The resolution of sonar (ability to distinguish objects) is limited by the wavelength of the sound. Higher frequencies provide better resolution but are absorbed more quickly. Low frequencies travel further but have poorer resolution.

                <p>
                    Sonar has wide applications, from navigation and mapping to military defense and marine research (e.g., studying whale communication).

                <h2 class="text-4xl">9. Medical Ultrasound: A Key Application of Acoustics</h2>
                <p>
                    As briefly touched upon in the <strong>Medical Physics</strong> lesson, medical ultrasound is a prime example of applying acoustic principles for diagnostic purposes. Its non-ionizing nature and real-time imaging capabilities make it invaluable in many clinical settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Medical ultrasound utilizes high-frequency sound waves (megahertz range) generated and detected by piezoelectric transducers. The images are formed based on the reflection of these sound waves at interfaces between tissues with different acoustic impedances. The time-of-flight of the echoes determines depth, and their intensity determines brightness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, <strong>Doppler ultrasound</strong> leverages the Doppler effect to measure blood flow velocity, critical for diagnosing vascular conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This application highlights the power of controlling and interpreting sound waves for visualizing the intricate structures and functions of the human body without harmful radiation.
