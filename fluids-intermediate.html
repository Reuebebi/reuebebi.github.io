                    <span class="glossary-term">Fluid statics</span> (or hydrostatics) is the study of fluids that are at rest and in equilibrium. It focuses on the forces exerted by fluids and the pressures within them.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    In a fluid at rest, pressure increases with depth. This is because the deeper you go, the more fluid is pressing down from above. For an incompressible fluid of uniform density ($\rho$) exposed to atmospheric pressure ($P_0$) at its surface:

                    <li>$\rho$: density of the fluid (in kg/m$^3$).</li>
                    <li>$g$: acceleration due to gravity ($9.8\, \text{m/s}^2$).</li>

                    This equation shows that pressure at a given depth depends only on the depth, the fluid density, and the pressure at the surface, not on the shape of the container. This is a crucial principle known as <span class="glossary-term">Pascal's Paradox</span> (not to be confused with Pascal's Principle below).

                    <p>What is the absolute pressure at a depth of $10\, \text{m}$ in a freshwater lake? (Assume atmospheric pressure $P_0 = 1.01 \times 10^5\, \text{Pa}$, density of water $\rho_{water} = 1000\, \text{kg/m}^3$).</p>
                    <p>Given: $h = 10\, \text{m}$, $P_0 = 1.01 \times 10^5\, \text{Pa}$, $\rho = 1000\, \text{kg/m}^3$, $g = 9.8\, \text{m/s}^2$.</p>

                    <p>$P = (1.01 \times 10^5) + (1000)(9.8)(10)$</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">2.2 Pascal's Principle</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    <span class="glossary-term">Pascal's Principle</span> states that a pressure change applied to an enclosed incompressible fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and to the walls of its container. This principle is the basis for many hydraulic systems.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Consider a hydraulic lift with two pistons of areas $A_1$ and $A_2$. A force $F_1$ applied to the smaller piston creates a pressure $P_1 = F_1/A_1$. According to Pascal's Principle, this pressure is transmitted throughout the fluid, so $P_1 = P_2$, where $P_2 = F_2/A_2$ is the pressure on the larger piston.
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$P_1 = P_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}$$
                </div>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    This allows a small force applied to a small area to generate a much larger force on a larger area, making it possible to lift heavy objects with relatively little effort. Hydraulic brakes, car lifts, and excavators all operate on this principle.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p class="font-bold mb-2">Example 2: Hydraulic Lift</p>
                    <p>In a hydraulic lift, a force of $100\, \text{N}$ is applied to a small piston with an area of $0.01\, \text{m}^2$. If the large piston has an area of $0.5\, \text{m}^2$, what maximum weight can it lift?</p>
                    <p>Given: $F_1 = 100\, \text{N}$, $A_1 = 0.01\, \text{m}^2$, $A_2 = 0.5\, \text{m}^2$.</p>
                    <p>Using Pascal's Principle: $\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}$</p>
