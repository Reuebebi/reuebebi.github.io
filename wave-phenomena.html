Waves are ubiquitous in nature, carrying energy without transporting matter. From the ripples on a pond to the sound of music, from the light that reaches our eyes to the radio signals that power our devices, understanding waves is fundamental to comprehending the physical world. This lesson builds upon the basic concepts of waves and explores their fascinating and often counter-intuitive behaviors.

                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Wavelength ($\lambda$):</span> The spatial period of the wave, the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. Unit: meters (m).</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Frequency ($f$):</span> The number of oscillations (cycles) per unit time. Unit: Hertz (Hz, or s$^{-1}$).</li>

                    Thomas Young's double-slit experiment (1801) provided conclusive evidence for the wave nature of light. When monochromatic light passes through two closely spaced narrow slits, an <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">interference pattern</span> of bright and dark fringes is observed on a screen.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Diffraction</span> is the phenomenon where waves spread out or bend around obstacles or through small apertures. It is a characteristic behavior of all waves, whether light, sound, or water waves. The extent of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the wave relative to the size of the obstacle or aperture.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Huygens' Principle</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Diffraction can be explained using <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Huygens' Principle</span>, which states that every point on a wavefront can be considered as a source of spherical secondary wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the speed of the wave. The new wavefront is the envelope of these wavelets. When a wavefront encounters an obstacle or aperture, only the points on the wavefront that pass through the opening act as sources of new wavelets, causing the wave to spread out beyond the geometric shadow.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    When monochromatic light passes through a single narrow slit, instead of a single bright line, a central bright maximum flanked by dimmer, narrower secondary maxima and dark minima is observed. This pattern is due to interference among wavelets originating from different parts of the single slit itself.

                    When two waves of the same amplitude and frequency traveling in opposite directions in the same medium superpose, they can create a <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">standing wave</span> (or stationary wave). Unlike traveling waves, standing waves do not appear to propagate; instead, they have fixed positions of maximum and minimum displacement.

                    Standing waves typically form in confined media, such as a string fixed at both ends, or an air column in a pipe. This confinement causes reflections, leading to waves traveling in opposite directions. For a standing wave to form, specific conditions related to the wavelength and the size of the medium must be met. These are known as <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">resonant conditions</span>.

                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Beats</span> are a phenomenon that occurs when two waves of slightly different frequencies superpose. Instead of a stable interference pattern, the resultant wave's amplitude (and thus its intensity or loudness for sound waves) varies periodically. This periodic variation is perceived as a "beating" sound or flickering light.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Formation of Beats</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Consider two sound waves with frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ that are very close to each other, traveling in the same direction. When these waves superpose, they will sometimes be in phase (leading to constructive interference and maximum amplitude) and sometimes out of phase (leading to destructive interference and minimum amplitude). This alternation creates the beat phenomenon.
                </p>

                    The <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">beat frequency ($f_{beat}$)</span> is the number of times per second the resultant amplitude goes through a cycle of maximum to minimum to maximum. It is simply the absolute difference between the two original frequencies:

                    For example, if two tuning forks produce sounds at $440 \text{ Hz}$ and $442 \text{ Hz}$, you will hear a sound with a frequency around $441 \text{ Hz}$ that gets louder and softer 2 times per second ($|440 - 442| = 2 \text{ Hz}$).

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    For light waves, the Doppler Effect is slightly different because light does not require a medium, and its speed is constant for all inertial observers (postulates of Special Relativity). The relativistic Doppler effect depends only on the relative speed between the source and the observer.
                    $$ f' = f \sqrt{\frac{1 \pm v_{rel}/c}{1 \mp v_{rel}/c}} $$

                    We've seen how the <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">Superposition Principle</span> underpins phenomena like <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">interference</span>, beautifully demonstrated by <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">Young's double-slit experiment ($d\sin\theta = m\lambda$)</span>. We explored how waves <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">diffract</span> (bend) around obstacles and through apertures, leading to patterns observed in single-slit diffraction and used extensively in <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">diffraction gratings</span> for spectroscopy.

                    The property of <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">polarization</span> unique to transverse waves, particularly light, was demystified, along with its various methods of creation and diverse applications in modern technology. We then delved into the intriguing world of <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">standing waves</span>, understanding their formation through resonance in strings and pipes, and how they contribute to music and acoustics. The concept of <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">beats</span> provided insight into how small frequency differences can lead to audible amplitude variations, useful in tuning.
