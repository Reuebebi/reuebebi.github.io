                    Welcome to <span class="font-semibold text-white">Whizmath</span>'s comprehensive study of <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Nuclear Radiation</span>! At the heart of every atom lies the nucleus, a tiny, dense core containing protons and neutrons. While many nuclei are stable, others are inherently unstable and undergo a process called <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">radioactive decay</span>, emitting particles and energy in their quest for stability. This emitted energy is what we call nuclear radiation.

                    The discovery of radioactivity revolutionized physics and opened up entirely new fields of science and technology, from nuclear power and medical imaging to carbon dating and fundamental research into the universe.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    To understand nuclear radiation, we must first briefly review the structure of the atom and the forces at play within its nucleus.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">The Nucleus: Protons and Neutrons</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Protons ($p^+$):</span> Positively charged particles. The number of protons defines the <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">atomic number ($Z$)</span>, which determines the element.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Neutrons ($n^0$):</span> Neutral particles (no charge).</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Nucleons:</span> A collective term for protons and neutrons. The total number of nucleons in a nucleus is the <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">mass number ($A = Z + N$)</span>, where $N$ is the number of neutrons.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Isotopes:</span> Atoms of the same element ($Z$) but with different numbers of neutrons ($N$), and thus different mass numbers ($A$).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Forces within the Nucleus</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The nucleus is held together by incredibly strong forces, overcoming the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged protons.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Strong Nuclear Force (Strong Interaction):</span> This is the strongest of the four fundamental forces. It is an attractive force that acts between all nucleons (proton-proton, neutron-neutron, proton-neutron) and is responsible for binding the nucleus together. It is a very short-range force, acting only over distances typical of the nuclear size ($<10^{-14} \text{ m}$).</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Electromagnetic Force (Coulomb Repulsion):</span> The electrostatic repulsion between protons within the nucleus. This is a long-range repulsive force.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Nuclear Stability</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    A nucleus is stable if the strong nuclear force is sufficient to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between protons. Nuclear stability depends primarily on the <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">neutron-to-proton ratio (N/Z)</span>.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        <li>For lighter nuclei ($Z \le 20$), stable nuclei tend to have $N \approx Z$ (e.g., Carbon-12 has 6 protons, 6 neutrons).</li>
                        <li>For heavier nuclei, more neutrons are required to provide additional strong nuclear force to counteract the increasing proton-proton repulsion. The stable N/Z ratio gradually increases, reaching about 1.5 for the heaviest stable nuclei (e.g., Lead-208 has 82 protons, 126 neutrons).</li>
                        <li>Nuclei outside this "band of stability" are unstable and undergo radioactive decay to achieve a more stable configuration.</li>
                        <li>There are no stable nuclei with $Z > 82$ (i.e., beyond Lead). All elements heavier than lead are radioactive.</li>
                        <li>Even-even nuclei (even number of protons and neutrons) are generally more stable than odd-odd nuclei.</li>
                        <li>"Magic numbers" of protons or neutrons (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126) correspond to particularly stable nuclei, analogous to electron shells in atoms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Unstable nuclei release energy and particles, transforming into more stable nuclei through various decay processes, which we will explore next.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Radioactive decay is a spontaneous process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. The original nucleus is called the <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">parent nucleus</span>, and the resulting nucleus is the <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">daughter nucleus</span>.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">1. Alpha Decay ($\alpha$)</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Alpha decay</span> occurs in very heavy, proton-rich nuclei (typically with $Z > 82$) that need to reduce both their proton and neutron numbers to become more stable.

                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Penetration Power:</span> Alpha particles are relatively large and carry a double positive charge, so they interact strongly with matter.

                    <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Beta decay</span> occurs in nuclei with an unstable neutron-to-proton ratio, typically when there are too many neutrons or too many protons relative to the band of stability. It is mediated by the weak nuclear force.

                    Radioactive decay is a random process at the individual atom level, but for a large number of atoms, the decay rate is predictable.

                    The number of remaining radioactive nuclei ($N$) after a time ($t$) can be calculated from the initial number of nuclei ($N_0$) and the half-life ($T_{1/2}$) using the formula:

                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Distance:</span> Increase distance from the source (intensity decreases with the square of distance).</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Shielding:</span> Use appropriate materials to block radiation (e.g., paper/skin for alpha, aluminum/plastic for beta, lead/concrete for gamma).</li>
