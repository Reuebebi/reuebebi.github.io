                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    In physics, <span class="glossary-term">momentum</span> is a crucial concept that quantifies the "quantity of motion" an object possesses. Unlike kinetic energy, which is a scalar quantity, momentum is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. It plays a central role in analyzing interactions between objects, especially in collisions and explosions.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    This lesson will begin by defining linear momentum and its close relative, impulse. We will then delve into one of the most powerful conservation laws in physics: the conservation of momentum. Finally, we'll apply these principles to various types of collisions, from simple one-dimensional impacts to complex two-dimensional interactions, and introduce a key parameter for collision analysis: the coefficient of restitution.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">1.1 Linear Momentum ($\vec{p}$)</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The <span class="glossary-term">linear momentum ($\vec{p}$)</span> of an object is defined as the product of its mass ($m$) and its velocity ($\vec{v}$).
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$$
                </div>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>$m$: mass of the object (in kilograms, kg).</li>
                    <li>$\vec{v}$: velocity of the object (in meters per second, m/s).</li>
                    <li>$\vec{p}$: linear momentum (in kilogram-meters per second, kgÂ·m/s).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Since velocity is a vector, momentum is also a vector, pointing in the same direction as the velocity. A heavier object moving at the same speed has more momentum than a lighter object. Similarly, an object with more speed has more momentum than the same object moving slower.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">1.2 Relationship to Newton's Second Law</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Newton originally formulated his Second Law in terms of momentum. He stated that the net force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\sum \vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$$
                </div>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    If mass is constant, this reduces to the more familiar $\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$ (since $\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$). However, the momentum form is more general, applicable even when mass changes (e.g., rocket propulsion).
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">1.3 Impulse ($\vec{J}$) and the Impulse-Momentum Theorem</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    When a force acts on an object for a period of time, it causes a change in the object's momentum. This change is quantified by <span class="glossary-term">impulse ($\vec{J}$)</span>. Impulse is defined as the integral of the net force over the time interval during which it acts:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\vec{J} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sum \vec{F} \, dt$$
                </div>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    If the net force is constant, this simplifies to:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\vec{J} = \sum \vec{F}_{avg} \Delta t$$
                </div>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The unit of impulse is Newton-seconds (NÂ·s), which is equivalent to kgÂ·m/s.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The <span class="glossary-term">Impulse-Momentum Theorem</span> states that the impulse imparted to an object is equal to the change in its linear momentum:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\vec{J} = \Delta \vec{p} = \vec{p}_{final} - \vec{p}_{initial} = m\vec{v}_{final} - m\vec{v}_{initial}$$
                </div>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    This theorem is incredibly useful for analyzing situations where forces act over short durations, such as collisions, impacts, and explosions, where the exact force profile might be complex but the change in momentum is readily measurable.

                    <p>A $0.045\, \text{kg}$ golf ball initially at rest is hit by a club. The club is in contact with the ball for $0.0005\, \text{s}$, and the ball leaves the club with a speed of $60\, \text{m/s}$.</p>
                    <p>a) Calculate the impulse imparted to the ball:</p>
                    <p>$\Delta \vec{p} = m\vec{v}_{final} - m\vec{v}_{initial} = (0.045\, \text{kg})(60\, \text{m/s}) - (0.045\, \text{kg})(0\, \text{m/s})$</p>
                    <p>$\Delta \vec{p} = 2.7\, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}$</p>
                    <p>So, $\vec{J} = 2.7\, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}$ in the direction of the ball's final velocity.</p>

                    This section needs more visual representations (diagrams of collisions with initial/final vectors). More complex examples involving angles for initial velocities, or solving for unknown angles or masses, would be very valuable. Discussion of glancing collisions vs. head-on collisions would also fit well here.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Real-world scenarios often involve more than two objects or a sequence of collisions. Analyzing these situations requires a systematic application of the conservation laws, often by defining appropriate systems and analyzing interactions step-by-step.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">6.1 Multi-Object Collisions</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The conservation of momentum applies to any system of particles, regardless of the number of objects involved. For a system of $N$ objects, the total initial momentum is equal to the total final momentum:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{v}_{ii} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{v}_{if}$$
                </div>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    This is particularly useful for explosions (where a single object breaks into multiple pieces) or chain reactions of collisions.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">6.2 Collisions with External Forces</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    While the principle of conservation of momentum strictly applies only to isolated systems, it can still be used effectively for systems where external forces are present, provided the collision duration is very short. In such cases, the external forces are often negligible compared to the large internal collision forces (impulsive forces).
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    If external forces cannot be neglected (e.g., a collision over a long duration where friction plays a significant role), then the Impulse-Momentum Theorem ($\vec{J}_{ext} = \Delta \vec{P}_{total}$) should be used, where $\vec{J}_{ext}$ is the impulse due to external forces.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">6.3 Center of Mass and Collisions</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The <span class="glossary-term">center of mass (CM)</span> of a system of objects is a unique point that represents the average position of all the mass in the system. An important property is that the total momentum of a system is equal to the total mass of the system multiplied by the velocity of its center of mass ($\vec{P}_{total} = M_{total} \vec{v}_{CM}$).
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    During a collision (whether elastic or inelastic), if there are no net external forces, the velocity of the center of mass remains constant. The individual objects within the system may change their velocities, but the "average" motion of the system as a whole (represented by its CM) continues uninterrupted. This provides a powerful way to check calculations and understand collision dynamics.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg italic text-gray-400">
                    This section could offer extensive examples of three-body collisions, explosions, and real-world scenarios where external forces must be considered. A detailed explanation and derivation of the center of mass velocity and position, especially how it simplifies collision analysis, would enhance this section significantly.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The principle of rocket propulsion is a direct application of the conservation of momentum. A rocket expels high-velocity exhaust gases backward (mass expelled, momentum in one direction), and in response, the rocket gains momentum forward (recoil). This occurs even in the vacuum of space, as no external medium is needed for the exhaust to push against.

                    In <span class="glossary-term">particle physics</span>, collisions between subatomic particles are central to research. Analyzing these collisions, often at extremely high energies, relies entirely on the conservation of momentum and energy (including mass-energy equivalence from relativity). Experiments in particle accelerators (like the LHC) are essentially highly controlled collision events.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">7.5 Ballistic Pendulum</h3>

                    The <span class="glossary-term">ballistic pendulum</span> is a classic physics experiment used to determine the speed of a projectile (like a bullet). It involves a perfectly inelastic collision (bullet embedding in a block) followed by the block-bullet system swinging upwards, allowing the initial speed to be calculated using a combination of momentum conservation (during the collision) and energy conservation (during the swing).

                    To achieve a very long document, this section could be expanded significantly. Each application could become a mini-case study with detailed physics explanations and derivations. For example, a full derivation of the rocket equation, or a step-by-step analysis of the ballistic pendulum. Further advanced topics could include angular impulse, impulse-momentum in rotational motion, and relativistic momentum for very high speeds.
