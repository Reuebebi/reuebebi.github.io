            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                In physics, <strong class="text-blue-300">momentum</strong> is a fundamental concept that describes the "quantity of motion" an object possesses. While closely related to force and energy, momentum provides a unique perspective on how objects interact, particularly during brief, intense events like collisions or explosions. Understanding momentum is crucial because, under specific conditions, the total momentum of a system remains conserved—a powerful principle that allows us to predict the outcomes of complex interactions without needing to know the intricate details of the forces involved.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Collisions are ubiquitous in the universe, from atomic-level interactions to car crashes, billiard games, and even galactic mergers. Analyzing these events requires careful application of conservation laws. Depending on whether kinetic energy is conserved, collisions are categorized as elastic or inelastic, each with distinct characteristics and methods of analysis. Furthermore, the direction of motion adds another layer of complexity, moving from one-dimensional head-on impacts to two-dimensional glancing blows.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                In this comprehensive lesson, we will embark on a detailed study of momentum and its conservation. We will differentiate between elastic and inelastic collisions, developing the mathematical tools to solve problems in both one and two dimensions. A key concept we will introduce is the <strong class="text-blue-300">coefficient of restitution</strong>, which quantifies the "bounciness" of a collision. By the end of this lesson, you will be equipped to tackle a wide range of complex collision problems, applying these powerful conservation principles to understand the dynamics of interacting objects.

        <!-- Section 1: Linear Momentum and Impulse -->
        <section class="mb-16">
            <h2 class="text-blue-400 font-semibold mb-6">1. Linear Momentum and Impulse</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                To begin our study of collisions, we first define linear momentum and a related concept, impulse.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-white font-medium mb-4">1.1. Linear Momentum ($\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$)</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong class="text-blue-300">Linear momentum</strong> ($\vec{p}$) is a vector quantity defined as the product of an object's mass ($m$) and its velocity ($\vec{v}$):
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
                <p class="text-blue-300 text-lg font-mono">
                    $$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$$
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The SI unit of momentum is kilogram-meter per second (kg·m/s). Like velocity, momentum has both magnitude and direction. A heavy, fast-moving object has a large momentum, but so does a lighter object moving very quickly.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-white font-medium mb-4">1.2. Newton's Second Law in Terms of Momentum</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Newton's Second Law, often stated as $\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}$, can be expressed more generally in terms of momentum:
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
                <p class="text-blue-300 text-lg font-mono">
                    $$\vec{F}_{net} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$$
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum. If the mass is constant, this reduces to $\vec{F}_{net} = m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m\vec{a}$. This form is particularly useful for systems where mass can change, such as rockets expelling fuel.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-white font-medium mb-4">1.3. Impulse ($\vec{J}$) and the Impulse-Momentum Theorem</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When a force acts on an object for a short period, it produces an <strong class="text-blue-300">impulse</strong> ($\vec{J}$), which is defined as the integral of the force over the time interval it acts:
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
                <p class="text-blue-300 text-lg font-mono">
                    $$\vec{J} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \vec{F}_{net} \, dt$$
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                If the net force is constant, $\vec{J} = \vec{F}_{net} \Delta t$. The unit of impulse is N·s, which is equivalent to kg·m/s (the unit of momentum).
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The <strong class="text-blue-300">Impulse-Momentum Theorem</strong> states that the impulse acting on an object is equal to the change in its momentum:
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
                <p class="text-blue-300 text-lg font-mono">
                    $$\vec{J} = \Delta\vec{p} = \vec{p}_f - \vec{p}_i = m\vec{v}_f - m\vec{v}_i$$
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This theorem is incredibly useful for analyzing collisions, where large forces act for very short durations. For instance, in a car crash, understanding the impulse helps engineers design safety features like airbags that extend the time of impact, thereby reducing the average force exerted on occupants.

        <section class="mb-16">
            <h2 class="text-blue-400 font-semibold mb-6">2. Conservation of Linear Momentum</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                One of the most fundamental conservation laws in physics is the <strong class="text-blue-300">Conservation of Linear Momentum</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-white font-medium mb-4">2.1. The Principle</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The principle states:
                <em class="text-blue-300">"If the net external force acting on a system of particles is zero, then the total linear momentum of the system remains constant."</em>
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
                <p class="text-blue-300 text-lg font-mono">
                    $$\sum \vec{F}_{ext} = 0 \implies \vec{P}_{total, initial} = \vec{P}_{total, final}$$
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                For a system of $N$ particles, the total momentum is the vector sum of individual momenta:
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-6 overflow-x-auto">
                <p class="text-blue-300 text-lg font-mono">
                    $$\vec{P}_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{p}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{v}_i$$
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                During collisions, the internal forces between colliding objects are typically much larger than any external forces (like friction or gravity) acting during the very short interaction time. Therefore, for collision problems, it's a very good approximation to assume that the net external force is zero, and thus, total momentum is conserved.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-white font-medium mb-4">2.2. Isolated Systems and Components</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                It's important to define the "system" carefully. An <strong class="text-blue-300">isolated system</strong> is one where no net external forces act on it. If a component of the net external force is zero (e.g., no external forces in the x-direction), then the momentum along that particular direction is conserved. This is particularly useful in 2D or 3D problems where momentum might be conserved along one axis but not another.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Conservation of momentum is a vector equation, meaning it holds true independently for each dimension (x, y, and z).

                A <strong class="text-blue-300">collision</strong> is an event in which two or more bodies exert forces on each other for a relatively short time. During this brief interaction, the forces between the colliding bodies (internal forces) are typically much larger than any external forces acting on the system, making momentum conservation a highly effective tool.

                While total momentum is conserved in all collisions (provided the net external force is negligible), kinetic energy may or may not be. This distinction leads to the classification of collisions:

Some kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy (e.g., heat due to deformation, sound, internal vibrational energy). Most real-world collisions fall into this category.

For instance, if one of the final angles (e.g., $\phi_1$) is known, the problem can be solved. A remarkable result for identical masses in an elastic collision with one initially at rest is that the two balls will always move off at $90^\circ$ to each other ($\phi_1 + \phi_2 = 90^\circ$).
