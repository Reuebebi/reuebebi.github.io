                    <span class="glossary-term">Gases</span> are one of the fundamental states of matter, characterized by their lack of definite shape or volume. Unlike solids or liquids, gas particles are widely dispersed and move randomly and rapidly, filling any container they occupy. The study of gases, particularly their macroscopic properties and behavior under various conditions, is a cornerstone of both physics and chemistry, forming the basis of <span class="glossary-term">thermodynamics</span> and kinetic theory.

                    This lesson will focus on the <span class="glossary-term">Ideal Gas Law</span>, a foundational equation that elegantly connects the measurable macroscopic properties of a gas. We will explore the historical empirical gas laws that led to its formulation, understand its underlying assumptions, and apply it to various thermodynamic processes. Finally, we will introduce the concept of <span class="glossary-term">real gases</span> and discuss when and why they deviate from the ideal model.

                    The behavior of a gas can be described by several key macroscopic (measurable) properties:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li><span class="glossary-term">Pressure ($P$):</span> The force exerted by gas particles colliding with the walls of their container per unit area. Unit: Pascal (Pa), atmosphere (atm), torr, mmHg, psi.</li>
                    <li><span class="glossary-term">Volume ($V$):</span> The space occupied by the gas. For a gas, this is equal to the volume of its container. Unit: cubic meter (m$^3$), liter (L).</li>
                    <li><span class="glossary-term">Temperature ($T$):</span> A measure of the average kinetic energy of the gas particles. In gas laws, temperature must *always* be in Kelvin (K). Unit: Kelvin (K), Celsius ($^\circ$C). Remember: $T(K) = T(^\circ C) + 273.15$.</li>
                    <li><span class="glossary-term">Amount of Gas ($n$):</span> Measured in moles (mol). A mole represents a specific number of particles ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms or molecules, Avogadro's number). Unit: mole (mol).</li>

                    These four variables are interconnected, and changing one often affects the others. The Ideal Gas Law provides the mathematical relationship between them.

                    The <span class="glossary-term">Ideal Gas Law</span> is an empirical law that describes the behavior of <span class="glossary-term">ideal gases</span> under various conditions. An ideal gas is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving point particles that are not subject to inter-particle interactions. While no real gas is perfectly ideal, this model serves as an excellent approximation for many gases under common conditions (relatively low pressure and high temperature).

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The Ideal Gas Law combines several empirical gas laws discovered in the centuries leading up to its formulation:

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The Ideal Gas Law can also be expressed in terms of the number of particles ($N$) and Boltzmann's constant ($k_B$):
                </p>
                <div class="equation">

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    This form highlights the connection between macroscopic properties and the microscopic world of individual particles. Note that $R = N_A k_B$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Another useful form is the <span class="glossary-term">Combined Gas Law</span>, derived when the amount of gas ($n$) is constant:

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    This allows for easy calculation of how a gas's properties change from an initial state (1) to a final state (2) when the amount of gas remains fixed.

                    While the Ideal Gas Law is a remarkably useful approximation, it is based on idealized assumptions that are not entirely true for <span class="glossary-term">real gases</span>. Real gas molecules do have a finite volume, and they do exert (weak) intermolecular forces on each other. These factors cause real gases to deviate from ideal behavior, especially under certain conditions.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">5.1 Conditions for Deviation</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Real gases deviate most significantly from ideal behavior under conditions of:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <li><span class="glossary-term">High Pressure:</span> At high pressures, the gas molecules are forced closer together. The finite volume of the molecules themselves becomes a significant fraction of the container volume, meaning the "empty space" assumption of the ideal gas model breaks down. Additionally, intermolecular attractive forces become more significant.</li>
                    <li><span class="glossary-term">Low Temperature:</span> At low temperatures, the average kinetic energy of the molecules is lower. This allows the attractive intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces) to become more dominant, causing molecules to "stick" together slightly or reduce the frequency/force of wall collisions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Conversely, real gases behave most like ideal gases at <span class="glossary-term">low pressure</span> and <span class="glossary-term">high temperature</span>.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    To account for the non-ideal behavior of real gases, various equations of state have been developed. The most common and widely recognized is the <span class="glossary-term">Van der Waals equation</span>, proposed by Johannes Diderik van der Waals in 1873. It introduces two correction factors to the Ideal Gas Law:
                </p>
                <div class="equation">
                    $$\left(P + \frac{an^2}{V^2}\right)(V - nb) = nRT$$

                    <li>$a$: A constant that accounts for the attractive forces between gas molecules. A larger 'a' indicates stronger attractive forces.</li>
                    <li>$b$: A constant that accounts for the finite volume occupied by the gas molecules themselves (the "excluded volume"). A larger 'b' indicates larger molecules.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The $(P + an^2/V^2)$ term corrects for the pressure reduction due to intermolecular attractions, while the $(V - nb)$ term corrects for the reduced "free" volume available to the molecules. The constants 'a' and 'b' are specific to each type of gas.
                </p>

                    <p>Ideal Gas Law: $P = \frac{nRT}{V} = \frac{(1.0)(0.0821)(273.15)}{0.5} \approx 44.8\, \text{atm}$.</p>
                    <p>For $\text{CO}_2$, van der Waals constants are $a \approx 3.59\, \text{L}^2\cdot\text{atm/mol}^2$ and $b \approx 0.0427\, \text{L/mol}$.</p>
                    <p>Van der Waals Equation (solving for P): $P = \frac{nRT}{(V-nb)} - \frac{an^2}{V^2}$</p>
                    <p>$P = \frac{(1.0)(0.0821)(273.15)}{(0.5 - (1.0)(0.0427))} - \frac{(3.59)(1.0)^2}{(0.5)^2}$</p>
                    <p>$P = \frac{22.42}{(0.4573)} - \frac{3.59}{0.25} \approx 49.03 - 14.36 = 34.67\, \text{atm}$.</p>
                    <p>At these conditions (relatively high pressure for the volume), the real gas pressure ($34.67\, \text{atm}$) is significantly lower than the ideal gas pressure ($44.8\, \text{atm}$) due to the attractive forces (dominant term here). The volume correction also plays a role.</p>

If $Z > 1$, the gas is less compressible (molecular volume dominates). $Z$ is often plotted against pressure and temperature in compressibility charts.
